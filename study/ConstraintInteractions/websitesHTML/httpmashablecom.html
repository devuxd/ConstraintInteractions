And the newly announced spin-off After Dark will continue that tradition for the upcoming Star Trek: Discovery series.\nFollowing in the footsteps of Nerdist host Chris Hardwick -- who practically invented the aftershow with The Talking Dead, Talking Bad, and Talking Saul -- After Trek will be hosted by fellow Nerdist Matt Mira. \n\n(We're assuming Chris Hardwick could not host because he was previously engaged in the aftershow for his aftershow's aftershow.)\nJokes aside, Mirra is well-suited for the job, as not only Hardwick's mentee but also as the host of his own discussion-oriented, pop culture deep-dives with podcasts like Star Trek: The Next Conversation and James Bonding.\nThe Star Trek: Discovery companion show will be a haven for trekkies who can't get enough of the newest generation. In the mold of the other aftershows mentioned, it'll bring together cast and crew members with a changing roster of celebrity fans to discuss the show. \nSEE ALSO: Netflix's 10 most-watched 'Star Trek' episodes totally redeems 'Voyager'\nStar Strek: Discovery is the latest return to the Starfleet, set ten years before Kirk, Spock and the Enterprise. Instead, it follows one officer's journey to discovering what it takes to truly understand alien life.\nPremiering via live stream on CBS All Access on Sept. 24 at 11:00 PM ET, After Trek's first guest will include Star Trek: Discovery stars Sonequa Martin-Green (First Officer Michael Burnham), James Frain (Ambassador Sarek) and executive producer and showrunner Aaron Harberts. The other episodes will air right after each new Star Trek: Discovery episode at 9:30 PM ET.\nWATCH: Trekkies rejoice, you can now pilot a 'Starfleet' ship in VR"},"shares":{"facebook":13,"twitter":92,"total":105},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/0N3QTJFIKoLKFuwsPhvjgSVLr5k=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F600977%2F2ea31724-0a0d-4291-bbac-7ea953eea65c.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ZZCBIJpHZpHl8lcnJJGZWvjTjpU=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57722%2F6837f927-1141-4d70-ad9b-4069ea5bbb38.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/fGKXBx2aA3z7QgAuapEdhb2uP-I=/175x175/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57722%2F6837f927-1141-4d70-ad9b-4069ea5bbb38.jpg","query":true,"size":"175x175#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/P7POM6FiDRBhx72aDSuUU55-vEA=/350x350/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57722%2F6837f927-1141-4d70-ad9b-4069ea5bbb38.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"350x350#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/f4alsJYZJzcJFEpT8Kdvb-b51d0=/80x80/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57722%2F6837f927-1141-4d70-ad9b-4069ea5bbb38.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"80x80#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/KytJN1w5gcDLkrMsxKCZr8_gxvE=/160x160/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57722%2F6837f927-1141-4d70-ad9b-4069ea5bbb38.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"160x160#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2yjKuor","display_title":"'Stark Trek: Discovery' announces companion show for fans who can't get enough","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"8P0BPAVl1q","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Never enough Trek, if you ask us.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":true,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"'Stark Trek: Discovery' announces companion show for fans who can't get enough"},{"_id":"59c59f9df11b2c6185000127","id":"2017/09/22/ahca-comic-kryptonite","title":"Comic creator calls Trumpcare 'kryptonite' for the industry","title_tag":null,"author":"Nicole Herviou","post_date":"2017-09-22T23:41:15+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 23:41:15 +0000","formatted_date":"36 minutes ago","formatted_shares":"151","sort_key":"1DVxzl","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/09/22/ahca-comic-kryptonite/","content":{"plain":"Many people will be negatively affected if the Affordable Care Act is repealed and replaced with the American Health Care Act.

But there are currently few signs that the country has achieved anything like the success it had in the U.S.\nSEE ALSO: Malicious hackers attack media startup after Hillary Clinton endorses it\nIn mid-2015, German officials discovered that some entity had cracked open the internal server of the Bundestag, one of two German houses of parliament. The people behind this entity stole a trove of data that included emails, possibly from members of the dominant political party – the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) – and even perhaps from the office of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who have proven to be something of a foil to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nIt took German officials some time to understand what happened, and why, but many details became clear the following year as the United States experienced something quite similar. \n\nRussian-linked hackers broke into the servers of the Democratic National Committee and stole a bunch of information that included emails. Those emails were released to the public in spurts that undermined the credibility of leading presidential candidate and Putin critic Hillary Clinton, showing that members of the DNC worked against her Democratic primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders. \nRegardless of whether that information should have done much damage to Clinton’s credibility, it was evident that these emails could turn news cycles against her in the lead-up to her election loss last November.\nWatching from Germany, officials figured something similar could happen to their national elections on Sept. 24. The group that hacked the DNC was allegedly the same group that hacked the Bundestag, and, if Putin has one European counterpart he’d like to disempower right now, that person is likely Merkel, who was a leader in the push for sanctions against Russia when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine.\nIf Putin has one European counterpart he’d like to disempower right now, that person is likely Angela Merkel.\nBut just hours before those elections take place, emails from the Bundestag hack have yet to be seen.\nResearchers have observed allegedly Russian-led disinformation campaigns in Germany as well, designed to undermine the credibility of Merkel and the CDU. This, too, occurred in the U.S. during its national election. But in Germany, alleged Russian influence attempts have either not materialized or not been as successful. Why?\nAn empty threat?\nIf you look up to see someone staring at you with a cocked fist, you expect to be punched. If, after a while, that punch doesn’t come, questions start to bubble up. \nSo it is in Germany with the Bundestag hack. Though Russian-linked hackers allegedly stole German politicians' emails, those emails haven’t been used to try to sway German voters to parties – whether right-leaning or left-leaning – that are more friendly to Russia than the CDU. \n\nThere’s still a chance these emails will hit the internet before the election. Russian-linked hackers dumped a bundle of information on the campaign of (now) French President Emanuel Macron in the days before the presidential election earlier this year in an attempt to sway voters toward Russia-friendly Marine Le Pen. \nThat attempt obviously failed. Macron won by a margin that, in the U.S., we’d call a landslide. And perhaps this is at least one of the reasons CDU emails haven’t been released online. Unlike the email dumps in the U.S., the French email release seemed much more desperate, and French law prevents the publication of political news items in the hours before an election. Macron was far, far ahead in the polls, and a good disinformation campaign is going to take more than a few days to get its roots into the minds of voters. In Germany, Merkel appears well on her way to a fourth term as chancellor, so why bother with an obvious influence attempt that is likely to do little damage?\n\n“The Russians work this long-term and with sequenced objectives,” said Joerg Forbrig, a senior transatlantic fellow with The German Marshall Fund, a transatlantic policy institute. “Ideally, they’d have prevented [Merkel] from taking office again. A couple of months ago, they must have seen that this was going to be impossible.”\nIt's possible “the emails written by German parliamentarians are simply too boring” to be worth publicizing.\nIt’s also possible that, as Die Zeit wrote in a May, 2017, article about the Bundestag hack, that “the emails written by German parliamentarians are simply too boring” to be worth publicizing. \nForbrig thinks it’s plausible that the hackers just don’t have any good information. As evidence for that theory, he cites “an attack” recorded earlier this month on a regional branch of the CDU that’s run by German politician and CDU member Julia Kloeckner, who is close with Merkel.\nIf these hackers had enough compromising information to do serious damage to Merkel’s election chances, why waste time trying to get more?\nSound the alarm\nGerman officials weren't quiet about pointing the finger at Russia.\nBruno Kahl, the head of the Bundesnachrichtendienst – the German equivalent of the CIA -- said in 2016 that there was evidence that cyber attacks on Germany came from the “Russian region” and that these attacks “have no purpose other than to elicit political uncertainty.” Hans-Georg Maaßen, who leads Germany’s FBI equivalent, described Russian officials as willing to “carry out sabotage.”\n\nIn November, 2016, Merkel said “we have to inform people” about the intent of such cyber assaults, and implored the nation “to know that there’s such a thing and learn to live with it.”\nAll this stands in contrast to the way the administration of former President Barack Obama handled evidence that Russia was behind attacks in the U.S. Wary of appearing to wade into the election, the Obama White House was much quieter about evidence of Russian interference. Trump, in even starker contrast, has often denied that Moscow meddled in the U.S. election. \nThe German media has also, according to experts, taken it upon itself to remain vigilant regarding Russian attempts at election interference. \"I can't tell you how many German interviews I’ve done in the last few months,” said Laura Galante, a senior fellow at The Atlantic Council’s Cyber Statecraft Initiative. \nReporters have asked questions about the nature of propaganda and disinformation, and how they can cover such things so their articles don’t boost that propaganda. \n\"I think the [German] media has taken a real responsibility,\" she said. \nSimilar attacks, different victim\nIn January 2016, news in Germany was consumed by the story of a girl named \"Lisa.\" \nShe was 13, a German girl of “Russian origin,” who said she'd been raped and implied that the  group of men who had attacked her were of Middle Eastern descent. \nA Russian TV station broadcast the story, and soon Russian outlets with a presence in foreign countries – outlets such as RT – pushed the story beyond the Russian border. The story made rounds on social media in January of 2016 and led to protests, which of course led to more coverage, this time in the German press. \n\nThe story was big and shocking, a gut-wrenching tale that fed into a growing political debate over how many immigrants from Middle Eastern and North African nations – fleeing violence of many kinds -- Germany could and should welcome. Merkel had at first welcomed these immigrants, but her welcome quickly cooled with political pressure.\nThe story of Lisa turned out to be largely fake. The girl later admitted to fabricating the alleged attack, though by this time the cycle of fake news had riled up groups already predisposed to nativism, and in doing so showed Germany the divisive potential of disinformation spread by Russian propaganda outlets, a key part in Moscow's alleged attempts to influence several elections outside Russia's borders.\nThe disinformation process can work in much the same way in the U.S. Clint Watts, who spoke before the Senate Intelligence Committee in April about how Russian-linked social media bots used fake information to influence the U.S. presidential election, described the process as “circular.” Fake stories often originate with Russian propaganda outlets, but sometimes those outlets and Russian-linked social media actors will inject conspiracy theories into information already floating around. \n\"Every time a conspiracy is floated from the [Trump] administration, it provides every outlet around the world, in fact, an opportunity to amplify that conspiracy and to add more manipulated truths or falsehoods onto it,” he said in an interview with NPR in April. \n\nThe story of “Lisa” is an example of the same disinformation effort, except in Germany. Yet, in Germany, experts said disinformation campaigns haven’t fractured the polity in the way such campaigns helped to do in the U.S.\n\"There were some attempts to try to exploit the political situation in Germany, but it's nothing compared to the political landscape in the U.S.,” said Tim Mauer, the co-director of the Cyber Policy Initiative at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \nThe nature of the U.S.’s two-party system can often lead to polarization, whereas Germany’s multi-party system leaves more room for constituents to find a spot somewhere in the relative middle. German media is also less politically aligned than media in the U.S., according to experts with knowledge of both media landscapes.\n“Germans have a far greater confidence in more traditional electronic and print media than in social media.”\nTrust in the press also varies widely in the two countries. A Gallup poll published in September 2016, in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election, showed that only 32 percent of Americans said they had a “great deal” or “fair amount” of confidence that “mass media” would “report the news fully, accurately and fairly.” In April of this year, a University of Würzburg study showed 55.7 percent of Germans trusted the media in 2016. \nGermans are also more likely than their U.S. counterparts to get their information from news outlets as opposed to social media.\n“Germans have a far greater confidence in more traditional electronic and print media than in social media,” Forbrig said. “The latter still do not play a major role for how citizens vote.”\nThe Alliance for Securing Democracy tracks “Russian influence campaigns on Twitter,” and their data makes it clear that such influence campaigns are pushing, for example, a right-wing alternative to Merkel’s CDU.\nBut while the effort is there, the results, so far, haven't materialized in the way alleged Russian influencers might have hoped.\n'A sword hanging over the German polity'\nGermany is, of course, still susceptible to Russian meddling.\nIf Russian officials decide there is no way to topple Merkel this election, as several experts believe they probably have, then perhaps they’ve decided to try to make it difficult for her to build a governing coalition, potentially weakening her political future. \n\"The threat of these attacks is, even if you don't change the outcome, all you have to do is inject some doubt into the process,” said Adam Segal, who directs the Digital and Cyberspace Policy Program at the Council on Foreign Relations. \n\nIt’s unclear how Russia would go about sowing doubt in the German electoral process. Mauer said all this focus on potential meddling has strengthened the integrity of German elections in the minds of the voting public, and experts said direct attacks on voting systems are unlikely to do much damage. Germany uses paper ballots, and while the results of those ballots are transmitted electronically, the systems used for such transmissions have lately been reinforced in preparation for Sept. 24. \nAlleged Russian disinformationists could instead try to cut Germany (and Merkel) off from other central European nations, using fake stories about \"dangerous immigrants\" to stir anger at Merkel’s perceivably lax stance on immigration.\nOr, perhaps Russian officials are waiting until after the election to dump information from the Bundestag hack – what Segal described as “a sword hanging over the German polity” – figuring that the information therein would work better to discredit Merkel than block her path to a fourth term as chancellor. \nAll legitimate concerns, experts say. But Sept. 24 looks set to be a relatively regular election -- at least for now. \nWATCH: Step inside the secretive class that turns people into hackers"},"shares":{"facebook":41,"twitter":326,"linked_in":5,"total":372},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/jMLQzSJzHEfDYlk9lgb87dnBE_g=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F601037%2F92c64103-6d3c-4c15-a978-c0509b3f9583.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/I68qwBoc7GarUETT-gPznmJCyiU=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57584%2F26ff433a-2f8d-4398-aad7-a3c2d906befc.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/pyQkJvVGb9qQjFKBtMhWJDUgjR4=/175x175/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57584%2F26ff433a-2f8d-4398-aad7-a3c2d906befc.jpg","query":true,"size":"175x175#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/dHvV7LdfaLI-4y0wvDlnEox_lPo=/350x350/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57584%2F26ff433a-2f8d-4398-aad7-a3c2d906befc.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"350x350#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/PICC1VYDwnXNzw-9rMigRcdFAZk=/80x80/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57584%2F26ff433a-2f8d-4398-aad7-a3c2d906befc.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"80x80#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ziltTQ76eSW0do_UKF8ph7oeVLI=/160x160/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57584%2F26ff433a-2f8d-4398-aad7-a3c2d906befc.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"160x160#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2wHHlSL","display_title":"Why Russia hasn't successfully screwed with Germany's election — yet","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"N8l6xqr01d","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Russian influence attempts in Germany have either not materialized or not been so successful.

Volvo Car USA President & CEO Lex Kerssemakers said the new deal will include \"everything but fuel,\" which sounds like an oversimplification of what it means to lease a car — but likely appeals directly to consumers who live in a grey area about who actually owns their precious smartphones. \nWATCH: Porsche's electric car might just give Tesla a run for its money"},"shares":{"facebook":27,"linked_in":4,"twitter":242,"total":273},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/e8aLygrtdMsEs3wexXtDvdQgTSo=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F601033%2Fe0c10c7b-3864-4eb8-85e1-618ae2f09f68.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/NS70hyP6cTiJj_f-zlx0gLCaGUk=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57738%2Fb95bf03a-e942-4e20-ad09-d02ea8b6291f.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/YR8-wEyuZ9gd_XAO06GaVSuFXpA=/175x175/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57738%2Fb95bf03a-e942-4e20-ad09-d02ea8b6291f.jpg","query":true,"size":"175x175#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/kBMyz6dWqMU0LjanfA3aGCXIm5A=/350x350/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57738%2Fb95bf03a-e942-4e20-ad09-d02ea8b6291f.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"350x350#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8wzKRSrI_CeHRYL8quDcb7oGsdo=/80x80/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57738%2Fb95bf03a-e942-4e20-ad09-d02ea8b6291f.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"80x80#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/B6nlfpOCnVPHZLxPLodu0khXkBM=/160x160/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57738%2Fb95bf03a-e942-4e20-ad09-d02ea8b6291f.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"160x160#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2xoTF7N","display_title":"Volvo wants you to treat your car just like your smartphone","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"panavz6lWV","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Would you trade in your car like your smartphone?","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":true,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Volvo wants you to treat your car just like your smartphone"},{"_id":"59c58eaf6df612571d000014","id":"2017/09/22/the-price-is-right-most-money-on-wheel-80000","title":"A milestone just happened on 'The Price is Right' and everyone rightfully freaked out","title_tag":null,"author":"Brian Koerber","post_date":"2017-09-22T22:29:03+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 22:29:03 +0000","formatted_date":" 2 hours ago","formatted_shares":"226","sort_key":"1DVwrt","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/09/22/the-price-is-right-most-money-on-wheel-80000/","content":{"plain":"{\"player\":{\"description\":\"The show gave away a combined $80,000 on Thethe Wheel. \",\"image\":\"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/fSyb6KgRySfLONcyMMXR-Nz53uA=/https%3A%2F%2Fvdist.aws.mashable.com%2Fcms%2F2017%2F9%2F5f49b407-2bbc-c552%2Fthumb%2F00001.jpg\",\"mediaid\":\"V4l9G4q0gK\",\"preload\":false,\"title\":\"A milestone just happened on 'The Price is Right' and everyone rightfully freaked out\",\"sources\":[{\"file\":\"https://vdist.aws.mashable.com/cms/2017/9/5f49b407-2bbc-c552/hls.m3u8\"},{\"file\":\"https://vdist.aws.mashable.com/cms/2017/9/5f49b407-2bbc-c552/dash.mpd\"},{\"file\":\"https://vdist.aws.mashable.com/cms/2017/9/5f49b407-2bbc-c552/mp4/1080.mp4\"},{\"file\":\"https://vdist.aws.mashable.com/cms/2017/9/5f49b407-2bbc-c552/mp4/720.mp4\"},{\"file\":\"https://vdist.aws.mashable.com/cms/2017/9/5f49b407-2bbc-c552/mp4/480.mp4\"}]},\"options\":{\"disableAds\":false,\"disableSharing\":false,\"nextupAction\":\"autoplay\",\"embedUrl\":\"http://mashable.com/videos/blueprint:V4l9G4q0gK/embed/?player=offsite\",\"standaloneUrl\":null,\"post\":{\"url\":\"http://mashable.com/2017/09/22/the-price-is-right-most-money-on-wheel-80000/\",\"date\":\"2017-09-22T22:29:03.230Z\",\"bp_id\":57724,\"wp_id\":null}},\"advertising\":{\"params\":{\"keywords\":\"cbs,culture,viral videos,the price is right,game shows\",\"sec0\":null,\"sec1\":\"\",\"prc\":\"\"}},\"analytics\":{\"labels\":\"cbs,culture,viral videos,the price is right,game shows\",\"videoSeriesName\":null}}While everyone has their favorite game on The Price is Right, The Big Wheel is definitely an indisputable highlight of the show. \nThe concept of the wheel is simple -- contestants are allowed two spins, and the person with the cumulative score closest to $1 advances to the Showcase, the show's grand finale. \nWith some magical stroke of luck, all three contestants managed to spin $1 in their two spins on Friday, a rare milestone occurrence. But today's episode was special, and each person that spun $1 received $10,000 for their spin. \nAfter giving away a cumulative $30,000 to the three contestants, host Drew Carey revealed they each received a bonus spin, and upped the stakes a bit. Landing on the green $.05 or $.15 will win the contestant an additional $10,000, while landing on the $1 is now worth $25,000. \nThe first and second contestants each hit the $1, so they both took home a cool $35,000 each. Combined, the show gave out $80,000 on this one game alone, which is the most amount of money ever given away on The Big Wheel, a rep from CBS confirmed. \nWhen people win big on TPIR, everyone freaks out, and this huge milestone was no exception. \n\nEsports events are taking over huge stadiums—and for good reasonGiant DIY bagel bite puts all the small ones to shameNo one is safe: 'South Park' game trailer pokes fun at Kanye West's momDIY Squad takes on a female version of Link from 'The Legend of Zelda' series"},"shares":{"facebook":46,"twitter":180,"total":226},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/EaBVfPHOfpMsppHcU5o61-AA-uI=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57724%2Fb1689c5d-2604-4671-b196-4289e0c411a9.png","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-eJAo6_PDkJqGkh86zsMZXtFtUc=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57724%2Fb1689c5d-2604-4671-b196-4289e0c411a9.png","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/O86lWFb6UJ-tJOcX_Cvo0wGoM6U=/175x175/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57724%2Fb1689c5d-2604-4671-b196-4289e0c411a9.png","query":true,"size":"175x175#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/4_xD7YjkNfnogzfZaxDiy1TtMOI=/350x350/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57724%2Fb1689c5d-2604-4671-b196-4289e0c411a9.png","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"350x350#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zk_PPS3GfkUcLfKS5TPAd7OIhHw=/80x80/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57724%2Fb1689c5d-2604-4671-b196-4289e0c411a9.png","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"80x80#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/NQNp_wjLVTfYhXeMM2mSr6HOtpI=/160x160/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57724%2Fb1689c5d-2604-4671-b196-4289e0c411a9.png","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"160x160#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2fGM7W6","display_title":"A milestone just happened on 'The Price is Right' and everyone rightfully freaked out","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"The show gave away a combined $80,000 on Thethe Wheel.

That means it's the end of an era for a black market selling soda providing sweet, sweet bursts of energy.\n“I’ve heard people talk about hiding mini-fridges on campus and doing an on-demand delivery service - get a can of soda delivered to you anywhere on campus any time,\" R. Alex Anderson, a 24-year-old master's student said via Twitter direct messaging. \nAnderson and other underground market customers shared their reactions to Thursday's news on social media, some disclosed bittersweet memories while others pointed out that the ban's end is not that big of a deal for students who took advantage of the connects. \nSEE ALSO: People aren't taking Coke Zero's demise very well\n\nDuring my last year at #BYU, my roommate helped run a caffeine bootlegging business.

The university announced that soft drinks with caffeine would once again be offered at dining halls and soda machines. \nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has clarified over the years that caffeine is not prohibited for Mormons, but hot beverages like coffee and tea aren't allowed. But the school has maintained its caffeine-free soda offering for decades -- until now, after officials claim demand for the drinks have gone up.

Staring directly into the camera, the Facebook CEO offered by far his biggest mea culpa. He looked, for lack of a better word, scared:\n\nHe should be. The revelations that Facebook's platform was used by Russia to target politically divisive ads represents a systemic threat to the empire that Zuckerberg has built in just 13 years. The threat doesn't come from its loyal users or from disgruntled advertisers or growing competition. Facebook has shown its ability to keep users happy, advertisers spending, and competition at bay. \nThe Russian controversy is about one thing that keeps Facebook executives up at night: government regulation. \nSEE ALSO: Facebook handed over info on those Russia-linked ads under a search warrant\nFacebook is now having to work with the government and, in the process, give politicians an idea of just how big and powerful it has become. Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, has led the charge here, and Democrats are pushing the Federal Election Commission to begin regulating online advertising in the same way it handles TV advertising. \nZuckerberg called the notion that fake news spread through Facebook had an impact on the election \"crazy.\" His tone has changed, as exemplified by Thursday's video. So has the company's entire treatment of the situation. It had initially said it could not reveal the ads—now it's handing over 3,000 of them voluntarily. \nThe change of heart is not a coincidence. Facebook can't avoid this anymore—it can only manage how bad this situation turns out. Now, it's going to need to do everything in its power to placate the U.S. government and try to convince politicians—and an increasingly skeptical public—that it will handle the situation.\nThe near-term for Facebook looks relatively safe. The Donald Trump administration has shown just about no interest in enacting aggressive new rules or even in enforcing old rules. The Democrats don't have enough power to actually push through any real changes in the FEC, let alone through Congress. \nThat said, this is a long game that Facebook has to play—and Zuckerberg knows it. Facebook will outlast the Trump presidency, and will need to make sure it is well positioned to keep the government at arm's length even in case of a President Elizabeth Warren or other pro-regulation advocate. \nFacebook is far from alone here. Google has had to play plenty of defense when it comes to U.S. government regulation. Tech companies are now some of the biggest spenders in the Washington D.C. lobbying industry. Sometimes that money goes to things like promoting immigration reform. Other times it goes to thinktanks that espouse the virtues of tech and how it shouldn't be regulated (or lay people off who don't think that way). \nBig Tech's aversion to regulation is entirely understandable. Facebook, Google, and Amazon have been allowed to grow into massive companies with no regulation. Along the way, they have destroyed their competitors and fundamentally changed their core industries, primarily advertising and retail sales. Regulation, at this point, would only dent growth and create opportunities for smaller competitors.\nThe prospect is very real, thanks primarily to Europe. European regulators have aggressively pursued tech companies over a variety of different issues including data privacy and anticompetitive practices. A variety of fines have been laid on tech companies, most notably $2.7 billion on Google over its shopping search results. \nFacebook had been able to almost entirely avoid U.S. government regulation. Now, the social network is at the center of a controversy that techno-skeptics would have had a tough time predicting even a few years ago. But we should have seen it coming.\nWhen Facebook was caught manipulating users' emotions in 2014, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said Facebook would never try to control elections. The implicit assumption there was that Facebook had indeed built a platform capable of doing such a thing—and had made that platform open for use to anyone with money.\nThe reality that Facebook has been used for this purpose now speaks to how little oversight the social network has been under. Zuckerberg on Thursday pleaded his case that Facebook is the best regulator of Facebook and that the company was launching a variety of efforts to make sure something like this never happens again. \nFacebook has given little reason to believe they are willing or capable of doing so. Self-regulation is the basic corporate move when having to admit something as monstrous as helping a foreign power influence an election. The company has routinely showed that it is riddled with errors—particularly within its vaunted ad platform—that seem to go uncorrected until noticed by outside observers. \nFacebook didn't win Trump the election. It helped. And it helped in a way that violates U.S. law. It helped in a way that violates U.S. law because its platform was engineered to be the most advanced advertising system in the world and be open to everyone. This is the same reason it has helped people target anti-semities or avoid people of color. It is unregulated. Anything goes. The market decides. \nThe lack of regulation has made Facebook into a $500 billion company. Facebook will do what it must to make sure it remains free of regulation. Even playing ball on the Russia investigation.\nWATCH: We got our hands on the iPhone 8 - here's everything you need to know"},"shares":{"facebook":30,"twitter":175,"linked_in":6,"pinterest":1,"total":212},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/7vT1HnWas1K9QBvbQbFB_Kn2TxY=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F600648%2F93d925db-b511-438f-bd94-afd5ec13ccd6.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/V9kj-d7FueBtikq0TnIQPCx4axc=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57684%2Fad2f686e-5e16-4411-b82f-5a0080c05e6e.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/DzFPVgv5EH08VI9XCM0FAq9Ou3s=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57684%2Fad2f686e-5e16-4411-b82f-5a0080c05e6e.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/KxvcrrojaBtsYnl0MOlHRTVMCnw=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57684%2Fad2f686e-5e16-4411-b82f-5a0080c05e6e.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/szDbsfmandSijnLhP_SqA2J-l_0=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57684%2Fad2f686e-5e16-4411-b82f-5a0080c05e6e.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/DTwyFNd2tBxW83qoDDrbB8YTDuI=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57684%2Fad2f686e-5e16-4411-b82f-5a0080c05e6e.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2wHuq3p","display_title":"What the Facebook/Russia controversy is actually about","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"qGo5xeAlW9","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"velocity":[1000,567,55,51,50,49,47],"show_sponsorship":true,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"What the Facebook/Russia controversy is actually about"},{"_id":"59c58b76f11b2c61850000b1","id":"2017/09/22/wisconsin-hacking-russia-election-2016","title":"Turns out Russia went after Wisconsin's voter registration system","title_tag":null,"author":"Jack Morse","post_date":"2017-09-22T22:15:17+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 22:15:17 +0000","formatted_date":" 2 hours ago","formatted_shares":"448","sort_key":"1DVx8g","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/09/22/wisconsin-hacking-russia-election-2016/","content":{"plain":"Another piece of the messed-up puzzle that was the 2016 U.S. presidential election fell into place today, as the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that \"Russian government cyber actors\" targeted the voter registration system of a key battleground state. \nWhile U.S. officials had already claimed that the Russian government went after 21 states' voter registration systems, this is the first time that names have been publicly named. And, sorry to say it Wisconsin, you have the dubious distinction of being the state in the spotlight. \nSEE ALSO: DEF CON's vote-hacking village made us think twice about election security\nAccording to Reuters, the Department of Homeland Security notified all 21 states on Sept. 22, with Wisconsin Elections Commission Administrator Michael Haas quickly identifying his specific state as being affected soon after.\nThe news agency reports Haas saying that the Russian government “scanned internet-connected election infrastructure likely seeking specific vulnerabilities such as access to voter registration databases, but the attempt to exploit vulnerabilities was unsuccessful.”\nNPR reports that officials from Washington and Connecticut also copped to the fact that their states' voter registration systems were targeted by Russian government hackers. \nImportantly, the voter registration system is not the same as the actual machines used to cast votes — and Matt Tait of cybersecurity firm Capital Alpha Security issued a warning to everyone currently freaking out. \nAlso since it was unsuccessful I am extremely skeptical of some of these attribution claims.— Pwn All The Things (@pwnallthethings) September 22, 2017\n\nThat sentiment, combined with the fact that DHS officials told Congress in June that it had no proof of actual successful vote tampering by the Russian government, suggests that while this is a big story, it's not a \"Russia stole the election\" story. \nStill, the fact stands that Wisconsin was a key battleground state in last year's election, and with today's revelation we now know that Russian officials were at least up to no good there. \nAs more officials come out and identify their states as also being targeted, which they are sure to do, we're likely to get a better picture — piece by hacked piece — of just what went down last year. \nWATCH: Here's everything you need to know about the new Apple Watch"},"shares":{"facebook":42,"twitter":402,"linked_in":3,"pinterest":1,"total":448},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bUAFxxLU-8PVxikmwVJXaBolH7E=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F601023%2F0d6c2acf-34ff-4a80-80cb-f2cdb159cff6.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/iM8WhuHDiSG6J8US0DPadTX151s=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57736%2F4806f8c1-4a02-4338-90ea-1dc0cb990096.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/y1tD4WykDxYsLzp4r4cZ23gK5hQ=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57736%2F4806f8c1-4a02-4338-90ea-1dc0cb990096.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/iYSwH-xjngQ9lzu_3863j_T7TpE=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57736%2F4806f8c1-4a02-4338-90ea-1dc0cb990096.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/E9gJQ0VdyhCdkF-1XLHmaMTgbG0=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57736%2F4806f8c1-4a02-4338-90ea-1dc0cb990096.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/1rdEuAsBc8DmVvWEf3qHab6BeYc=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57736%2F4806f8c1-4a02-4338-90ea-1dc0cb990096.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2jRyxDR","display_title":"Turns out Russia went after Wisconsin's voter registration system","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"gjnL9JLl2q","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"velocity":[1000,859,720,693,643,884,881,855,691,794,775,860,755,748,737,660,759,634,595,656,643],"show_sponsorship":true,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Turns out Russia went after Wisconsin's voter registration system"},{"_id":"59c5882628cc3622630000e9","id":"2017/09/22/star-wars-thinkgeek-sale","title":"There's a major sale on Star Wars gear going on right now","title_tag":null,"author":"Emily Heller","post_date":"2017-09-22T22:01:09+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 22:01:09 +0000","formatted_date":" 2 hours ago","formatted_shares":"237","sort_key":"1DVx6i","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/09/22/star-wars-thinkgeek-sale/","content":{"plain":"Just to let you know, if you buy something featured here, Mashable might earn an affiliate commission.As anticipation around The Last Jedi mounts and we all go crazy for Porgs, Star Wars fever is sky high.

hungry, bored electric car drivers who miss gas stations filled with bathrooms, scratch off lottery tickets, and beef jerky. \nThe automaker has a plan to add convenience store-esque amenities to its fast-charging stations, according to a report from Restaurant Business spotted by Grub Street. The new plans would transform Supercharger stops from single-purpose power-up stations to mini rest stops.    \n“People are coming and spending 20 to 30 minutes at these stops,” Tesla CTO J.B. Straubel told an audience at foodservice-technology conference FSTEC, referring to the Supercharger's estimated half hour power-up time. “They want to eat, they want to have a cup of coffee, and they want to use the bathroom.”   \nSEE ALSO: Nikola and Bosch set to battle Tesla with hydrogen-electric semi trucks\nStraubel then showed off an \"aerial depiction\" of a tricked out Supercharger station outfitted with all the hallmarks of a convenience store, according to the report. A Tesla rep couldn't send Mashable an image of the rendering when reached for comment, so we can only imagine that it looked like any old rest stop you can find off major highway exits. \nThe automaker isn't going all in and starting up its own chain of Supercharger-adjacent eateries, however. Straubel dismissed the idea of a Tesla-run food management operation, instead shifting the focus to potential partnerships. “We already have been working with restaurants,” he said. “That can only start scaling up.”\nTesla says that it specifically places its Superchargers near amenities like hotels, restaurants, and shopping areas to give drivers something to do while their car is charging up. The company is missing out on a massive potential revenue stream by declining to monetize the areas even more — so there's no reason it shouldn't build out its own version of 7/11 stores. \nWATCH: This is how much a fully loaded Tesla Model 3 costs"},"shares":{"facebook":42,"twitter":238,"linked_in":3,"total":283},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/LydrhMcLHo8frxfA-mMRD1Qb-iA=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57715%2Fdf6604e7-90e1-40ab-b307-1e0de1f8b7ae.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5yqrgDna-wQU-s3WxclaVZKZm4U=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57715%2Fdf6604e7-90e1-40ab-b307-1e0de1f8b7ae.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/LBx89A_D0Ns2HmWEWn7JVMBteLI=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57715%2Fdf6604e7-90e1-40ab-b307-1e0de1f8b7ae.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/jwWIoHOfb1pc7ui3t0B0DOlxsbc=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57715%2Fdf6604e7-90e1-40ab-b307-1e0de1f8b7ae.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gcD1Xu3wI8jdCVE7CWhdU61TcQU=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57715%2Fdf6604e7-90e1-40ab-b307-1e0de1f8b7ae.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/kEGJLfY1ftBZUfgVdywiFI63LNQ=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57715%2Fdf6604e7-90e1-40ab-b307-1e0de1f8b7ae.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2xoCWkM","display_title":"Tesla might trick out its Supercharger stations like 7/11 stores","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"gjnL57Rl2q","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"velocity":[10,8,7,6,7,1000,952,815,606],"show_sponsorship":true,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Tesla might trick out its Supercharger stations like 7/11 stores"},{"_id":"59c57de128cc36226300009b","id":"2017/09/22/netflix-hdr-not-real-iphone-8-plus","title":"The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus don't really support true HDR video playback","title_tag":null,"author":"Raymond Wong","post_date":"2017-09-22T21:17:19+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 21:17:19 +0000","formatted_date":" 3 hours ago","formatted_shares":"331","sort_key":"1DVwg1","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/09/22/netflix-hdr-not-real-iphone-8-plus/","content":{"plain":"{\"player\":{\"description\":\"Come for the glass back, stay for the A11 Bionic chip and wireless charging.\",\"image\":\"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/MUrWdNsCY_QrPthLgwL2HkPtasU=/https%3A%2F%2Fvdist.aws.mashable.com%2Fcms%2F2017%2F9%2Ffbdfe2e5-39ae-5519%2Fthumb%2F00001.jpg\",\"mediaid\":\"jmnr8rOo1R\",\"preload\":false,\"title\":\"The iPhone 8 is excellent, but not for everyone\",\"sources\":[{\"file\":\"https://vdist.aws.mashable.com/cms/2017/9/fbdfe2e5-39ae-5519/hls.m3u8\"},{\"file\":\"https://vdist.aws.mashable.com/cms/2017/9/fbdfe2e5-39ae-5519/dash.mpd\"},{\"file\":\"https://vdist.aws.mashable.com/cms/2017/9/fbdfe2e5-39ae-5519/mp4/1080.mp4\"},{\"file\":\"https://vdist.aws.mashable.com/cms/2017/9/fbdfe2e5-39ae-5519/mp4/720.mp4\"},{\"file\":\"https://vdist.aws.mashable.com/cms/2017/9/fbdfe2e5-39ae-5519/mp4/480.mp4\"}]},\"options\":{\"disableAds\":false,\"disableSharing\":false,\"nextupAction\":\"autoplay\",\"embedUrl\":\"http://mashable.com/videos/blueprint:jmnr8rOo1R/embed/?player=offsite\",\"standaloneUrl\":null,\"post\":{\"url\":\"http://mashable.com/2017/09/19/apple-iphone-8-and-iphone-8-plus-review/\",\"date\":\"2017-09-19T11:00:00.000Z\",\"bp_id\":57144,\"wp_id\":null}},\"advertising\":{\"params\":{\"keywords\":\"tech,apple,iphone,smartphone,smartphones,reviews,review,mashable choice,iphone 8,iphone 8 plus\",\"sec0\":null,\"sec1\":\"\",\"prc\":\"\"}},\"analytics\":{\"labels\":\"tech,apple,iphone,smartphone,smartphones,reviews,review,mashable choice,iphone 8,iphone 8 plus\",\"videoSeriesName\":null}}Smartphones like Samsung's Galaxy Note 8, LG's V30, and even Apple's iPhone 8 and iPhone X are finally getting HDR (High Dynamic Range) video support, which means any HDR content you play on them will look better. Like, noticeably better. \nHDR content looks better because it has visible improvements like greater dynamic range and brighter highlights that makes the picture quality more realistic and authentic to the director's original artistic vision.\nBut something's not adding up, especially on the new iPhone 8 and 8 Plus.\nSEE ALSO: 8 reasons why buying an iPhone 8 makes more sense than the iPhone X\nApple advertises on its website that the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus support \"Dolby Vision and HDR10 content.\"\nFrom that statement, you'd think that these new iPhones would display HDR in all of its eye-popping glory. But you'd be wrong.\nTo get the full benefit of HDR content, your device needs to have an HDR display. HDR content requires special display tech to properly render it.\nFor instance, you'd need a screen with a certain level of brightness (measured in nits), with a certain contrast ratio spec, and wide color gamut display support, to see all the extra improvements.\nIt's kind of like watching 4K content. The only way to really appreciably view 4K content is on a 4K TV or monitor.\nThis is why you need to buy a brand new TV with HDR support in order to view HDR content. Your rinky-dink TV just won't do if you want all that extra picture quality.\n\nSo what's the big deal? Well, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus don't have HDR displays. The iPhone X is the only iPhone and Apple device with an HDR screen. Apple says it right there on its iPhone comparison page.\nWithout the necessary hardware for HDR, then what the heck are you actually seeing on the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus when you load up a Dolby Vision movie on Netflix? That's a good question because the answer wasn't exactly obvious.\nNormally, if your screen doesn't support HDR, it simply won't be able to read the signal and you'll see the standard non-HDR version.\nBut that's not the case on the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. Apple told Mashable that users of these two phones will see visual enhancements to dynamic range, contrast, and wide color gamut when playing Dolby Vision or HDR 10 content from their respective content providers, but it will not be at the full level of HDR visual fidelity as it'll be on the iPhone X, which does have an HDR screen.\nWe also reached out to Netflix, but they referred us to Apple. Dolby didn't immediately respond to our request for clarification on the faux-HDR support for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus.\nI know it's a little confusing, but you could think about it like this: Many phones have an HDR mode within their camera app. When you take an HDR photo or video, instead of seeing blown-out areas, you see added colors and details.\nYou're not technically looking at true HDR content but to the naked eye you're seeing some discernible differences. Better video quality is better video quality, but if you want to watch HDR the way it was meant to be, you're going to need to get a device with an HDR screen.\nWATCH: Apple's iOS 11 finally turns the

country. "},"shares":{"facebook":52,"twitter":214,"linked_in":2,"pinterest":3,"total":271},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/3fbiVVrXpQ8dATDVnKIq069G6t0=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57666%2F01808248-df9a-4688-b27d-510b25aa4850.png","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/n5m9Lmo5hkQRYBk__Qk70xU3-f4=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57666%2F01808248-df9a-4688-b27d-510b25aa4850.png","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/s_i-YlhjpsUNa0b4vYm3tpjJgm8=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57666%2F01808248-df9a-4688-b27d-510b25aa4850.png","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/p5KFlakeenYizP7B0qqPf08Z-0Q=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57666%2F01808248-df9a-4688-b27d-510b25aa4850.png","query":"(min-resolution:

sold on Beats by Dre’s extraordinary Studio3 wireless headphones.\nI was walking down Fifth Avenue, my blue Studio3 headphones hugging my ears as I listened to a new podcast featuring Nerdist CEO Chris Hardwick and Adam Savage. As I walked, I noticed a guy walking in the opposite direction with his fingers jammed in his ears. He was grimacing. What, I wondered, was his deal? I double-pressed a tiny button on the Studio3’s right headphone and I heard it. It came slowly at first as the Adaptive Noise Canceling (ANC) tech wound down, and then roaring through. I pulled the headphones off my ears and the sound from outside was deafening.\nSEE ALSO: Here's everything you need to know about the new Apple Watch\nI put the headphones back on, double-pressed the ANC button again and listened as the ear-splitting cacophony drained away. I heard only muffled sounds and when I started the podcast again, it was all I heard.\nBeats by Dre Studio3 wireless Bluetooth headphones represent the first major update to one of the company’s most iconic models since Apple acquired Beats in 2014. \nThe $349 headphones look pretty much like they did three years ago, though there are some new colors: Shadow Gray, Porcelain Rose, Matte Black, White, Blue, and Red. More important, they're filled with excellent new technology, including Apple’s W1 communication chip (but not the new W2 chip Apple just introduced in the Apple Watch Series 3; guess that’ll have to wait for the Studio4's). That power-sipping chip means the Studio3 headphones could play for up to 22 hours, more than double the play time of the previous model.\n\nFor me, the chip meant that, after an overnight charge via a microUSB port (the charging cable is included), I could connect the headphones to my iPhone simply by turning them on by holding the power button down for a few seconds and placing them near the phone. On screen, an image of the headphones appeared along with a large “Connect” button. Once I selected that, the screen showed remaining battery life by percentage. Once paired with one device, they're available for any device on the same iCloud account.\n\nThe Beats by Dre Studio3 headphones arrive folded up in their artificial-leather case. It’s a little bulky to carry with you everywhere. At least Beats smartly provides a metal snap hook that you can attach to the case and your backpack.\nThe over-the-ear headphones unfold and adjust easily. In addition to the power button, which doubles as the ANC enable/disable button, the left headphone has two hidden buttons. The Beats logo at the center of the left side is a large play/pause/call pickup button and the quarter-inch ring around it is for volume. Sadly, there are no gesture controls like you can find on Parrot’s $400 Zik 3 Wireless headphones.\n\nI wore the headphones for hours at a time. The cushions create a good seal on my ears and the 9.17-ounce headset felt comfortable. My lack of hair meant that I could feel the connecting arch resting on top of my head. Even with the cushion up there, I didn’t like how that felt, but those of you with full heads of hair likely won’t notice this at all. My only other complaint is that my ears did feel a little sweaty after extended wear, but then that’s all over-the-ear headphones, isn’t it?\nSound quality\nI listened to a wide variety of audio content, everything from movies to games to music to podcasts. I listened to rock, pop, alternative and more.\nOn podcasts like Marc Maron's WTF and Syfy’s Syfy25 (that Adam Savage podcast), it felt like I was sitting in the same room as the hosts. I swear, I could hear their lips smacking. On movies, the headphones make good use of the stereo sound, providing solid spatial presence for a surround-sound feel.\n\nWith music, I could make it ear-splittingly loud, but even at lower volume, I heard details I’d never noticed before. At the start of David Bowie’s “Dollar Days” off the Blackstar album, I could hear the rustling of bills. In song after song, I could pick out each instrument; everything was distinct, nothing was muddy. The sound achieved impressive highs, a solid midrange and head-thumping bass.\nNo more noise\nWith the Studio3, Beats introduces something it’s calling Pure ANC. The proprietary Adaptive Noise Cancelling technology goes, according to the company, beyond traditional ANC, constantly adapting to changing environmental conditions. It listens to outside noises, adjusts for sound leaks caused by an inconsistent seal with your head and compares the sound you’re hearing with the clean wave file and adjusts the sound to make sure they still match.\nIt’s hard to know if the Beats Studio3 headphones are effectively doing all that, but I can tell you that I am impressed with how well the ANC worked. Along with the stunning jackhammer demonstration, the headphones completely cut out all the chatter and train noise during my commute.\n\nWhen I turned the music off and just walked around with the headphones on, the only thing I heard, or maybe more accurately felt, was the vibration of my feet hitting the pavement.\nThere were times when I could feel the ANC adjusting, it was like an air-pressure change, but that feeling never took me out of the aural experience. \nThe more I used Beats Studio3, the more I wondered how I would ever go back to using Apple AirPods. I like them, but the sound experience doesn’t even compare to over-the-ear ANC-enhanced headphones. That’s not surprising, and I do get other benefits with Apple's tiny AirPods. They’re a lot cheaper, tiny, comfortable and easy to carry. More importantly, they automatically pause the audio when I remove one from my ear. The Studio3 headphones have no such awareness.\nI also made phone calls with the headphones. It worked smoothly and the microphone cleanly picked up my voice. The headphones also work with Siri. So, I can say, “Hey Siri,” and hear the response through the Studio3 headset.\nAs for battery life. I’ve charged the headphones once since I got them. They still have more than 40% battery life left. 22 hours does not seem like a stretch. I could get almost double that if I turned off ANC, but, then, why would I?\nBeats by Dre Studio3 Wireless Headphones\n          The GoodAmazing noise-cancelling technology • Great battery Life • Very comfortableThe BadNo gesture controls • PriceyThe Bottom LineThe Beats Studio3 headphones are one of the best Bluetooth wireless models we’ve ever tested.\n          \n\nWATCH: We got our hands on the iPhone 8 - here's everything you need to know\n\nEvery editorial product is independently selected by Mashable journalists.

Rather than just tossing it into “the drawer” (because we all have one of those drawers) and forgetting about it altogether, you can resell your previous generation iPhone and find it a new home.\nThis process might seem daunting, but eBay makes it extremely easy to sell your phone and make some quick money. And eBay offers some of the most competitive pricing across the market — for example, an iPhone 7 Plus 256 GB is selling for upwards of $630 on eBay, compared to $380 on Gazelle or $360 at AT&T.* \nFrom creating an eye-catching listing, to shipping your phone to your buyer, here’s everything you need to know about reselling your iPhone on eBay.\n\nPrepare your phone\nBefore you’re ready to list your phone for sale, be sure that it’s properly backed up so that you don’t lose all of your data when you switch to your new model. Once that’s done, it’s important to make sure all of your personal data gets cleared. In addition to wiping your phone completely, there are some additional things you’ll want to do to secure your information.\nPRO TIP #1: Backup your data \nFirst, deactivate Find My iPhone by going to your Settings and sliding the service to “off.” When Find My iPhone is turned on it can block activation for the new owner. You’ll also want to sign out of iCloud and iMessage so that there is no confusion or lost messages when you start using your new phone. And if you have an Apple Watch, unpair it from the iPhone you’ll be selling by placing it next to your phone, opening the Apple Watch iPhone app, and selecting it under the My Watch tab. As a final step, erase all of your phone’s data by going into Settings and selecting General, then Reset, and finally Erase All Content and Settings.\n\nDo some research\nOnce your phone is wiped and ready for a new owner, find out its re-sale price.\nPRO TIP #2: Erase all of your phone’s current settings\nHead to eBay to check out the trending price for your phone model. Find out things like your phone’s storage capacity, camera specs, and which accessories are compatible with it to ensure that your buyers are fully informed about the product and better able to make their purchase decision.\n\nCreate an eye-catching listing\nA successful listing on eBay includes great photos and a succinct item description. When you take photos of your phone for the listing, use good lighting and try to photograph it against a solid backdrop. You’ll want to take photos from every angle, including close-up shots and photos of any accessories you are selling with it.\nFor the listing itself, a catchy title and simple, descriptive text is essential. Since eBay’s search engine uses titles to surface listings during someone’s search, using keywords that state its carrier, model, color, and storage is a good place to start. You could also include things like “jailbroken” or “mint condition” to provide some more information. In the description itself you can go into more detail about the condition of your phone, why you’re selling it, and explain what, if any, damage there is.\nShip it to your buyer\nPRO TIP #3: Print your shipping label using eBay labels\nOnce you have a confirmed buyer and are ready to ship your phone, eBay makes it easy to send it off.  Pack your phone in a sturdy box and wrap it in bubble wrap to protect it from any damage during transit.

The former means that it's more likely than not that sexual harassment or violence occurred while the latter requires campus investigators to determine the accusations are highly probable or reasonably certain. \nSHAMEFUL: Betsy DeVos (@BetsyDeVosED) rolls back sexual assault protections. #TitleIX https://t.co/nquVfaAq2W— HumanRightsCampaign (@HRC) September 22, 2017\n\nCampus sex assault allegations are investigated by school officials as a violation of federal sex discrimination law -- not criminal statutes. The Obama administration argued the preponderance of the evidence standard reflected Supreme Court practices when evaluating civil litigation of sex discrimination cases. The interim guidance now allows schools to use either standard of evidence. \nDeVos, who was previously a business executive and Republican political operative, vehemently disagreed with that approach. \"Washington dictated that schools must use the lowest standard of proof … it’s no wonder so many call these proceedings 'kangaroo courts,'\" she said earlier this month. \"Kangaroo courts\" has become a conservative talking point used to describe campus investigations of sexual assault. \nAdvocates of the Obama-era guidance denounced DeVos' decision as irresponsible. \nToday, the Trump administration put the concerns of abusers over survivors. Again. Trust survivors, always. https://t.co/9us5XuVKk5— Women's March (@womensmarch) September 22, 2017\n\n\"With sexual assaults routinely going unreported, uninvestigated and unpunished, the scales are already heavily tipped in the favor of rapists,\" Nita Chaudhary, co-founder of the women's advocacy group UltraViolet, said in a statement. \"The idea that we need to focus more on the rights of the accused was almost laughable before this decision, now it’s just terrifying and dangerous.\"\nFatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center, said in her own statement that the new guidance will have a \"devastating impact\" on students and school because it'll discourage students from reporting assaults and create uncertainty for schools. \n\"This misguided directive is a huge step back to a time when sexual assault was a secret that was swept under the rug,\" she said.  \n\nOther advocacy organizations opposed to the decision include the American Association of University Women, Human Rights Campaign, and Planned Parenthood. Vice President Joe Biden spoke out against the expected policy changes earlier this week in a PSA for the It's On Us campaign. \n\"We cannot let that stand. So don't give up,\" he said. \"Speak out. Demand that your school continue to make progress.\" \nThe Department of Education will solicit comment from the public as it develops its new official policy on how colleges should handle campus sexual assault. \nBased on the preliminary response from advocates, the department may want to prepare for an avalanche of angry feedback. \nWATCH: Lara Croft is back and more badass than ever"},"shares":{"facebook":91,"twitter":139,"linked_in":2,"total":232},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bEtVip4TYrLlFH6tL0BVV9wDQaQ=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F600854%2F31998cfd-d735-49e7-95ea-a3caadc9a0f4.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/JxlMX7T2NLXt0Qs-spBUn72GtNg=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57713%2F36c89a13-672c-4ff3-9068-82ad53bed0df.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-61YWT3rt8xJW2Bep8MFs0c-RVY=/638x368/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57713%2F36c89a13-672c-4ff3-9068-82ad53bed0df.jpg","query":true,"size":"638x368#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8JAnn3GBDOIe39PAd4EtEsUrBb0=/1276x736/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57713%2F36c89a13-672c-4ff3-9068-82ad53bed0df.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"1276x736#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-WfyVdckwxOOqitA631RjUW9aJA=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57713%2F36c89a13-672c-4ff3-9068-82ad53bed0df.jpg","query":"(max-width: 1160px)","size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-u_NZK-EgF55AiooKk-mYLJV9g4=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57713%2F36c89a13-672c-4ff3-9068-82ad53bed0df.jpg","query":"(max-width: 1160px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/qR-bMWaSRgS7ydM3f4fEk5IINH8=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57713%2F36c89a13-672c-4ff3-9068-82ad53bed0df.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/0AOg6uCw9WKGDG0s-IVmHSy3kU8=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57713%2F36c89a13-672c-4ff3-9068-82ad53bed0df.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2jRoZJ9","display_title":"Betsy DeVos makes fears come true by revoking Obama-era rules on campus sexual assault","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"67n7v4r0Pq","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"\"This misguided directive is a huge step back to a time when sexual assault was a secret that was swept under the rug.\" ","show_sponsorship":true,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Social Good","channel_label":"Social Good","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/social-good/","tweet_text":"Betsy DeVos makes fears come true by revoking Obama-era rules on campus sexual assault"},{"_id":"59c57bb1f11b2c618500005f","id":"2017/09/22/mark-zuckerberg-chan-billion-voting-shares-reclassify","title":"Mark Zuckerberg is gifting as much as $12.8 billion to his own foundation in 2018","title_tag":null,"author":"Kerry Flynn","post_date":"2017-09-22T21:08:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 21:08:00 +0000","formatted_date":" 3 hours ago","formatted_shares":"267","sort_key":"1DVx1h","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/09/22/mark-zuckerberg-chan-billion-voting-shares-reclassify/","content":{"plain":"Must be nice to be a billionaire. \nJust a day after he somewhat apologized for somewhat undermining democracy, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared Friday he would be fueling his own philanthropic organization with about $12.8 billion over the next 18 months.\nSEE ALSO: Mark Zuckerberg's refusal to make Russia-linked Facebook ads public is a disgrace\nThis announcement came just after news broke that Facebook would be withdrawing a plan to reclassify the company's stock. Zuckerberg was scheduled to testify on the matter in Delaware Chancery Court in just a few days.\nZuckerberg had wanted to create a new pool of non-voting shares that would allow him to retain control of the company while also sticking to his plan to give away 99 percent of his and his wife's Facebook shares over their lifetimes. \n\"Facebook’s board determined that withdrawing the reclassification was in the best interests of Facebook and its shareholders,\" a Facebook spokesperson wrote in a statement. \nAccording to Zuckerberg, it apparently was a mistake on his part. \n\"At the time, I felt that this reclassification was the best way to do both of these things.

The mission is \"advancing human potential and promoting equality,\" according to its Facebook Page. In January, the team hired David Plouffe, formerly Uber's head of policy and an Obama alum. \nThe organization has made several investments over the last two years. Last week, the organization revealed it invested in RISE, a group that works to protect the civil rights and provide support for sexual assault survivors. CZI also recently gave a grant to Measures for Justice, an organization for criminal justice reform. \nEarlier this year, CZI donated $3.6 million to housing crisis relief in the Bay Area, The Mercury News reported. \nWATCH: Porsche's electric car might just give Tesla a run for its money"},"shares":{"facebook":146,"linked_in":5,"twitter":116,"total":267},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/g3NuKalLyKPzlgEPV_s3o2qI6Sw=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F601014%2F4626cbe2-5cee-41c7-97ed-e5773d1a9cec.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/vwnxR-sXhVh-vBCOPg_3ulAHfDE=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57730%2F275c7a73-28f8-4c01-8bfb-7c458feb9afa.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/d7ozoXRGeke6iUgaW0aKCO1G0II=/638x368/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57730%2F275c7a73-28f8-4c01-8bfb-7c458feb9afa.jpg","query":true,"size":"638x368#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8LCrVopISZnmllP0DQSeMco0mhs=/1276x736/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57730%2F275c7a73-28f8-4c01-8bfb-7c458feb9afa.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"1276x736#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/WKSaA6W6LG4Ssh6jYYCPrujk6Kw=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57730%2F275c7a73-28f8-4c01-8bfb-7c458feb9afa.jpg","query":"(max-width: 1160px)","size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/P8AfkrhIfERcteKzisr5r7vpTDk=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57730%2F275c7a73-28f8-4c01-8bfb-7c458feb9afa.jpg","query":"(max-width: 1160px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/XkNRpRDXhgCor36eQwi06kEvzpE=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57730%2F275c7a73-28f8-4c01-8bfb-7c458feb9afa.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/u3fQDtvyduRZKiQcTuqBDnk1I5s=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57730%2F275c7a73-28f8-4c01-8bfb-7c458feb9afa.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2jRvE66","display_title":"Mark Zuckerberg is gifting as much as $12.8 billion to his own foundation in 2018","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"panavz6lWV","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"And he no longer needs to testify in court.","show_sponsorship":true,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Mark Zuckerberg is gifting as much as $12.8 billion to his own foundation in 2018"},{"_id":"59c5835df11b2c618500007f","id":"2017/09/22/john-mccain-tweet-graham-cassidy-healthcare-bill","title":"John McCain just body-slammed Trumpcare and the bill's sponsor tweeted a surprising response","title_tag":null,"author":"Keith Wagstaff","post_date":"2017-09-22T21:40:42+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 21:40:42 +0000","formatted_date":" 3 hours ago","formatted_shares":"803","sort_key":"1DVweS","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/09/22/john-mccain-tweet-graham-cassidy-healthcare-bill/","content":{"plain":"The latest trainwreck of a GOP health care plan looks likely to die -- and, once again, John McCain could be the dude who killed it. \nOn Friday, the Republican senator announced he would vote against the Graham-Cassidy bill.

So anticipating a future need for water in the midst of a natural disaster, three years ago Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma committed to producing and keeping a 70,000-can stock of water in the case of an emergency.\n\"A couple of years ago we thought about what we could do to help the community,\" said Mascarua. \"Mexico usually gets hit during the hurricane season. So we thought it was a good idea to have water in stock in different regions.\"\nThe brand ordinarily produces beers like Heineken along with Tecate and Dos Equis at their plants. So to produce water, they needed to make some changes. The company needed approval from Mexico's government, and they would need to have a facility that could comply with the country's drinking water standards. They decided to equip their Orizaba, MX plant with the government-approved and permitted infrastructure necessary to produce water. They ran their first pilot of water production and distribution last year. And before the two recent earthquakes hit, had compiled a store of 70,000 cans. \n\"A lot of people think that this was an idea of this weekend.\"\n\"A lot of people think that this was an idea of this weekend,\" said Mascarua. \"No, it requires a lot of planning. It requires obtaining authorization because water has to be purified, you have to clear the beer from the system. There’s a lot of things behind it.\"\nAfter the 8.1-magnitude earthquake hit off of Mexico's southern Pacific coast on Sept. 7 and devastated parts of Oaxaca, Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma began distributing their 70,0000-can stock of water, which they keep in different locations across the country. The company coordinated with Mexico's agency for Civil Protection, but largely used their own delivery trucks and employees to get the water where it was needed most.\n\"Having the water in stock in different regions in Mexico gives you the ability to respond within hours,\" said Mascarua.\nEnviamos nuestro apoyo a Oaxaca donando 30 mil botellas de agua potable. ¡Estamos con 🇲🇽 más que nunca! pic.twitter.com/X9CWWHNj9F— Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma (@cuamocmx) September 19, 2017\n\nStepping up\nBut once the second smaller, but more urban and deadly, earthquake hit on Sept. 19, the need for water started to exceed what they already had on hand. The leadership of Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma gathered, and decided to halt beer distribution at the Orizaba plant. They have pledged to produce and distribute an additional 1 million cans. \n\"We met as a crisis team, and within the first few minutes of the meeting, we made a decision,\" said Mascarua. \"We are very aligned on our mission of building a better Mexico.\" \nCans initially went to affected areas in Oaxaca, Puebla, and Mexico City. But with widespread damage, Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma is deciding where to send the additional cans, as they're produced, in real time. \nThey announced the initiative on Facebook, writing \"more help is coming to Oaxaca And Morelos!\"\n\nThe Mexican regions that will receive water are Mexico City, Mexico State, Oaxaca, Chiapas, Puebla, and Morelos. They will distribute the water to aid workers who are trying to recover victims, as well as those who have lost their home or access to water thanks to broken or corrupted tanks.\n\"This is happening as we speak because we are getting reports and we’re trying to see which are the areas that require the most, and we’re trying to address those first,\" Mascarua explained. \nThe response to the company's efforts have been largely positive on social media. \n\"I would be proud to one day work in a company like this that puts the interests of the people affected before their income by beer; ')\" wrote Facebook user Pedro Sanchez on the brand's page.\n\nThough Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma had infrastructure and systems in place, they have still faced challenges marshaling the resources necessary for the relief effort. \n\"Without a doubt we have faced challenges,\" said Mascarua. \"Our business is to produce beer. So you have to stop your equipment, stop your brewery operations with beer. Clean the equipment. Put the water in cleaners and can the water.

The company also plans to build a new, separate battery plant near the current facility. Daimler claims the new developments will create more than 600 new jobs. \nWorkers at the newly e-focused factory will make the automaker's upcoming line of electric SUVs, the EQ, which debuted last year at the Paris Auto Show. The battery plant, which will be the fifth such site for the company globally, will produce batteries to support both the SUVs built at the Tuscaloosa plant and other electric Mercedes-Benz vehicles around the world. \nSEE ALSO: Porsche's gorgeous electric sports car looks to knock off Tesla's Model S in 2019\nThe futuristic EQ SUV will have an estimated range of 310 miles per charge, and Daimler says that it will feature the \"latest status of automated driving\" when it launches, although there's no firm date yet. Production is slated to begin at the start of the next decade, as soon as the necessary upgrades are made to the current facilities.\n\nDaimler's investment comes after other automakers have shifted their attentions to electric vehicles. Ford committed to launching 13 new electrified models by 2020 in 2015, while Volvo announced over the summer that all of its vehicles will use electric motors as soon as 2019. Mercedes-Benz says it will electrify its \"entire portfolio\" by 2022, touting that the future will bring more than 50 electrified vehicles. \nElectrification is coming, whether automakers make pledges to update their fleets or not. Tesla's flashy all-electric vehicles have built up massive hype in the automotive scene, while legislators around the world are working to promote the use of electric cars and even ban OG gas engines for environmental reasons. Daimler is taking a step into the future with its commitment to electric cars — but it's a step that all carmakers will eventually have to take to stay on the road. \nWATCH: Charge your electric car with these inductive roads as you drive"},"shares":{"linked_in":38,"facebook":120,"twitter":268,"total":426},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/KAKxnar52RtOnGNrdEuIylBlPzc=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F600704%2Ff1b5965e-d001-4775-a556-11511a3977cf.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/cl8tc5w-HjXeue3_DMOujkyF3UE=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57701%2Fd81d361b-9af9-44b3-aee6-7908cf12d959.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/w3XNsZkdE87DuFoRbx0JJmCCFEs=/638x368/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57701%2Fd81d361b-9af9-44b3-aee6-7908cf12d959.jpg","query":true,"size":"638x368#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ibJOdzll2QFmEWO1sqDM20B2CZc=/1276x736/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57701%2Fd81d361b-9af9-44b3-aee6-7908cf12d959.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"1276x736#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/nq-Xjj3c1HnvFx_nyq7qMmkI7M0=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57701%2Fd81d361b-9af9-44b3-aee6-7908cf12d959.jpg","query":"(max-width: 1160px)","size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/H30MktFcYyASDM4uXR1vT7NbWnM=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57701%2Fd81d361b-9af9-44b3-aee6-7908cf12d959.jpg","query":"(max-width: 1160px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/qCOCXsKYeUROSBuOOQgbZsStPuA=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57701%2Fd81d361b-9af9-44b3-aee6-7908cf12d959.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/t9MS3FrWKfqnyBaFs0juJSCUIos=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F57701%2Fd81d361b-9af9-44b3-aee6-7908cf12d959.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2yj4xTB","display_title":"Mercedes-Benz pours $1 billion into electric car production in the U.S.","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"A6nG59OoNv","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Mercedes-Benz is going all-in on electric cars in the U.S. ","show_sponsorship":true,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Mercedes-Benz pours $1 billion into electric car production in the U.S."}]
