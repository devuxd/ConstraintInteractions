Race-car tracks coiling through the hallways? Perhaps a gaggle of elfin employees, scootering in and out of meeting rooms on mint-colored mini-Vespas with blueprints for next season\u2019s must-have toys?<\/p>\n<p>I found no such frivolities\u2014or merriment of any other sort\u2014at Mattel\u2019s corporate headquarters in El Segundo, Calif. Inside the banal, 14-story tower are all the hallmarks of a run-of-the-mill, old-economy compound: cubicles, mostly blank walls, and library-like silence. Even the top-floor C-suite is disappointingly un-fun. Yes, there is a display of limited-edition Barbies\u2014complete with gem-studded dresses and miniaturized stilettos. But tethered to pedestals and imprisoned in glass cases, the dolls appear more showpiece than plaything. \u201cYou can look, but you can\u2019t touch,\u201d the injection-molded figurines seem to whisper from pursed and plumped lips. One wonders if anyone ever actually has any fun here.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-margo.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2160680\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/mattel-ceo-most-powerful-women\/mat-10-01-17-margo\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-margo.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=702\" data-orig-size=\"2800,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Angie Smith for FORTUNE&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 5D Mark II&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1505384307&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;43&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.016666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;MAT.10.01.17.margo&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"MAT.10.01.17.margo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-margo.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=702?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-margo.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=702?w=1024\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2160680\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-margo.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=702\" alt=\"MAT.10.01.17.margo\" width=\"1024\" height=\"702\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-margo.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=702 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-margo.jpg?w=2048&amp;h=1404 2048w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-margo.jpg?w=150&amp;h=103 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-margo.jpg?w=300&amp;h=206 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-margo.jpg?w=768&amp;h=527 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Rewiring the Dreamhouse: Margo Georgiadis, a Google veteran, became Mattel\u2019s CEO in February.

In a grand corner suite, Mattel\u2019s new CEO, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/most-powerful-women\/margo-georgiadis-49\/\">Margo Georgiadis<\/a> (Fortune&#8217;s 2017 <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/most-powerful-women\/\">Most Powerful Women<\/a> list, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/most-powerful-women\/margo-georgiadis-49\/\">No. 49<\/a>), is talking, even laughing, with her chief operating officer, Richard Dickson. The two share the office, working side-by-side at stand-up desks that look comically current in these stodgiest of business quarters.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere was a real feeling that leaders were not accessible, and kind of \u2018ivory-towerish,\u2019\u2009\u201d the chief executive, who took office eight months ago, says of Mattel\u2019s past. \u201cWhat better message to send than, \u2018I don\u2019t need this big fancy office\u2014I can share it.\u2019\u2009\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a collision of cultures that Georgiadis welcomes\u2014one, you could say, that she was hired to create.

The latter is sacrilegious to a Googler: \u201cI almost feel like I\u2019m in the 1990s,\u201d Georgiadis admits.<\/p>\n<p>She might as well be in the 1950s or 1960s, because the products that Mattel introduced in those decades\u2014flagship franchises Barbie and Hot Wheels\u2014still make up about 30% of the 72-year-old company\u2019s global sales. These aging brands consistently rank among the top toys sold worldwide (see \u201cHow Little Things Change\u201d below), but they haven\u2019t exactly been springboards for innovation. And not coincidentally, Mattel\u2019s revenue has slipped in recent years: In its last fiscal year, sales came in at $5.5 billion, 14% less than in 2012. Its stock price, meanwhile, has slid from $37 to $16 over the past five years.

Among the factors Johnson blamed: \u201cFatigue in certain properties associated with multiple sequels, and competition from entertainment from other screens.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ah, yes, those \u201cother screens.\u201d In a digitally saturated era where even toddlers reflexively grab their parents\u2019 smartphones for stimulation, technology presents a seemingly unsolvable puzzle for traditional toymakers. The more kids consume iPad apps and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/netflix\/\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix<\/a> shows, the less time they spend playing with dolls or snapping together small, colorful bricks. (Privately held Lego has also suffered: In early September, following a 5% drop in midyear sales, the Danish company announced it would slash 8% of its workforce.) From an outsider\u2019s perspective, the industry stands at an existential threshold: To break out of its rut, it has to go digital.<\/p>\n<p><em>For more about Mattel&#8217;s tech efforts, read &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/mattel-barbie-ceo-google\/ \u200e\">5 Ways Toymaker Mattel Is Trying to Be More Like Google<\/a>.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>But here\u2019s the problem: Kids may love screens, but it\u2019s not clear that they like \u201ctech toys.\u201d The toys they gravitate toward\u2014or at least the toys their parents buy for them\u2014remain largely analog. Think Pok\u00e9mon cards, Nerf guns and balls, and, yes, Barbie dolls, all among the five bestselling toy properties this year, according to research firm NPD Group. \u201cThere are pockets driven by technology,\u201d says Juli Lennett, an NPD analyst. \u201cBut most growth still tends to be driven by some of the classic play patterns.\u201d Another example: The fastest-growing category of toys sold so far this year was games and puzzles, a grouping that doesn\u2019t include video games. As Stephen Pasierb, CEO of the Toy Association, a trade organization, argues, \u201cMany parents want their kids to have some digital detox.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-medium-width aligncenter\" style=\"max-width:500px;\" ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat_graphic1.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2158907\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/mattel-ceo-most-powerful-women\/mat_graphic\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat_graphic1.png?w=500&#038;h=594\" data-orig-size=\"1220,1450\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"MAT_graphic\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Charts show toy sales in the U.S., and activities kids are engaged in&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat_graphic1.png?w=500&#038;h=594?w=252\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat_graphic1.png?w=500&#038;h=594?w=862\" class=\"wp-image-2158907\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat_graphic1.png?w=500&#038;h=594\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"594\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat_graphic1.png?w=500&amp;h=594 500w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat_graphic1.png?w=1000&amp;h=1188 1000w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat_graphic1.png?w=126&amp;h=150 126w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat_graphic1.png?w=252&amp;h=300 252w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat_graphic1.png?w=768&amp;h=913 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat_graphic1.png?w=862&amp;h=1024 862w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Nicolas Rapp<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Parents may not want screens and technology to replace toys. They do, however, want toys that meet the expectations that tech creates\u2014more interactivity and customization, for starters. They also want to be able to buy toys without going shopping, which helps explain why once-dominant retailer <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/19\/toys-r-us-bankruptcy-protection\/\">Toys \u201cR\u201d Us filed for bankruptcy<\/a> in mid-September, buckling under the weight of e-commerce giant <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/amazon-com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a> (and creating another headache for big toymakers). As Mattel board member Dean Scarborough, chairman of labelmaker <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/avery-dennison\/\" target=\"_blank\">Avery Dennison<\/a>, puts it, the business is no longer a simple process of \u201cproducing an item, advertising on TV, and pushing it into the stores.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This is the gauntlet Georgiadis is running. The exec is already shaking things up, in a Google-y way, developing a shared technical infrastructure for toy development and investing in digital marketing. (Until recently, nearly all of Mattel\u2019s ad spending was invested in television.) \u201cWe needed someone from the digital world,\u201d says Scarborough. \u201cAnd it\u2019s pretty hard to get more digital than Google.\u201d Ruth Porat, the search giant\u2019s chief financial officer, expresses faith in her former colleague, pointing out that Georgiadis ran one of Google\u2019s most important businesses, giving her the background she\u2019ll need for \u201capplying cutting-edge tech into all parts of Mattel\u2019s business.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Some toys, though, are better left in their analog state, and Georgiadis will have to know which levers to pull and when. There\u2019s nothing particularly high-tech about the Chatter Telephone, for example. On the windowsill in the CEO\u2019s shared office sits the smiling, plastic pull toy, first developed in 1961. It is a reminder that all the 0s and 1s in the world don\u2019t diminish the appeal of a ringing rotary phone, as far as babies (and their parents) are concerned. In 2000, Mattel upgraded the old model with a push-button design that lit up. The result? Consumers protested, and the company brought back the original version.<\/p>\n<p>If there\u2019s a lesson there, perhaps it\u2019s this: In a data-driven age, there is a science to developing products that match kids\u2019 \u201cplay patterns.\u201d But there is also an art.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>After taking the top job last February, Georgiadis did what all new outsider CEOs are expected to do: She traveled the country, talking to as many of Mattel\u2019s 32,000 employees as possible. Then she tore down a Barbie Dreamhouse.<\/p>\n<p>Like Barbie herself, the mockup Malibu pad, first conceived of in 1962, has gotten multiple touch-ups over the years. By the \u201970s, the one-story abode had grown to three floors and an elevator. In the 1990s Mattel spruced it up with a working doorbell and a fireplace that lit up. And last holiday season, Barbie moved into her first \u201cWi-Fi, voice-activated\u201d Dreamhouse, which enabled kids to open doors using spoken commands. (With a price of $240, that\u2019s about $30 per square foot.)<\/p>\n<p>But according to Georgiadis, Wi-Fi wasn\u2019t enough to bring the 58-year-old Barbie into the Internet age. That\u2019s why she brought a screwdriver to the weekly management meeting and took apart the latest Dreamhouse, laying out each component\u2014and each flaw\u2014for all to see.<\/p>\n<p>For starters, the voice-activated parts had a cumbersome amount of circuitry. \u201cThere were, like, seven chipboards in that thing,\u201d Georgiadis says. Not only were the chipboards completely separate\u2014not communicating with each other\u2014but Mattel wasn\u2019t using them to their full potential. The toymaker wasn\u2019t recording or saving Dreamhouse owners\u2019 voice commands\u2014much less combining them into a system that could learn and evolve, otherwise known as natural language processing. \u201cYou want to know, how many times did she [the owner] talk to it, what questions does she ask that you don\u2019t answer?\u201d says Georgiadis. For an executive schooled at Google, whose parent company Alphabet makes $90 billion a year primarily by pumping data into algorithms and using it to serve up ads, this lapse was unfathomable.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-medium-width aligncenter\" style=\"max-width:450px;\" ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-hotwheelsdesign.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2160683\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/mattel-ceo-most-powerful-women\/mat-10-01-17-hotwheelsdesign\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-hotwheelsdesign.jpg?w=450&#038;h=679\" data-orig-size=\"1272,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;6.3&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Angie Smith for FORTUNE&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 5D Mark II&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1505388667&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;35&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;250&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.02&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;MAT.10.01.17.hotwheelsdesign&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"MAT.10.01.17.hotwheelsdesign\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-hotwheelsdesign.jpg?w=450&#038;h=679?w=199\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-hotwheelsdesign.jpg?w=450&#038;h=679?w=678\" class=\"wp-image-2160683\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-hotwheelsdesign.jpg?w=450&#038;h=679\" alt=\"MAT.10.01.17.hotwheelsdesign\" width=\"450\" height=\"679\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-hotwheelsdesign.jpg?w=450&amp;h=679 450w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-hotwheelsdesign.jpg?w=900&amp;h=1358 900w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-hotwheelsdesign.jpg?w=99&amp;h=150 99w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-hotwheelsdesign.jpg?w=199&amp;h=300 199w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-hotwheelsdesign.jpg?w=768&amp;h=1159 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-hotwheelsdesign.jpg?w=678&amp;h=1024 678w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Staffers work on Hot Wheels at Mattel\u2019s Design Center in El Segundo, Calif.

(Other chip-equipped Mattel toys, like a Hot Wheels track that uses computer smarts to steer cars around, suffered from the same problem.)<\/p>\n<p>The most encouraging thing about the deconstruction session: Georgiadis\u2019s colleagues got the message. \u201cThe minute we took the thing apart to explain all of the opportunities we were missing, everyone said. \u2018Oh, my God, that\u2019s so obvious,\u2019\u2009\u201d she says. Now she\u2019s realigning the company around that kind of revelation. She has hired a chief technology officer who has taken over all engineering resources. More developers are being hired, and a common technology platform for things like voice recognition is in the works. Georgiadis envisions that, someday, language processing tech developed with the Dreamhouse in mind will also be used in, say, a Fisher-Price baby swing, to track how a child\u2019s cry is impacted by different speeds. \u201cSkip the focus group,\u201d she says, because with tech, \u201cYou have an everyday focus group.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The new CEO is utilizing data elsewhere too. She wants to move Mattel entirely to shared systems\u2014enterprise resource planning software, for example, and collaboration tools like Yammer. \u201cForecasting, demand planning, all these kinds of things are more data-driven,\u201d says Georgiadis; the tools she favors could make that kind of information available to more people, more quickly.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-prototypes.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2160681\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/mattel-ceo-most-powerful-women\/mat-10-01-17-prototypes\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-prototypes.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=702\" data-orig-size=\"2800,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;11&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Angie Smith for FORTUNE&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 5D Mark II&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1505389626&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;27&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;250&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.025&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;MAT.10.01.17.prototypes&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"MAT.10.01.17.prototypes\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-prototypes.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=702?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-prototypes.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=702?w=1024\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2160681\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-prototypes.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=702\" alt=\"MAT.10.01.17.prototypes\" width=\"1024\" height=\"702\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-prototypes.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=702 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-prototypes.jpg?w=2048&amp;h=1404 2048w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-prototypes.jpg?w=150&amp;h=103 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-prototypes.jpg?w=300&amp;h=206 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-prototypes.jpg?w=768&amp;h=527 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Angie Smith for FORTUNE<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Getting Mattel\u2019s divisions to collaborate poses geographical challenges too. While flagship brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels operate out of headquarters in Southern California, other divisions are cleaved from the core. Many are acquisitions that are still parked in their hometowns. American Girl, maker of dolls from different points in history, is based in Wisconsin. Mega, a block-toys arm, is in Canada, and Fisher-Price, the brand for smaller tots, is based in New York, to name a few. \u201cThis company that had a huge potential was really almost like a house of brands,\u201d says Georgiadis. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a shared mission.\u201d To get everyone on the same page, Georgiadis has written a new code of shared values (the initials of the six precepts spell out \u201cWONDER\u201d) and instituted monthly Google-style \u201ctown halls.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>For more on Georgiadis&#8217;s reforms at Mattel, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/mattel-barbie-ceo-google\/ \u200e\">click here<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Of course, however sweeping her reforms, there is no real-life Magic 8 Ball (the Mattel-owned toy launched in the 1950s) that can help Georgiadis see which products will sell and which will flop. Will parents want their kids\u2019 voices recorded, even if anonymized and used to improve products?<\/p>\n<p>Still, observers think she\u2019s on the right track internally. Mattel\u2019s bureaucracy has likely stifled innovation. How could smart ideas bubble to the top when it was hard for designers to even reach the management on the top floor? \u201cLiterally, there were guards and codes and badges,\u201d says Dickson, the COO and Georgiadis\u2019 office mate, who has spent 13 years at Mattel. No one, until Georgiadis, had ever asked him to share an office. No one had broken down the silos between brands. In fact, no one had even managed to bridge the gap between the company\u2019s corporate tower and the flatter, cooler building right across the street.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>The day after I visit the tower, I tour the \u201cDesign Center,\u201d a warehouse-style building with high ceilings and, well, a lot of toys\u2014a space that\u2019s as fun as the HQ is drab. This is where about 700 of the company\u2019s creatives sit\u2014toy developers, graphic designers, and even Barbie hair specialists. There are no elves or mopeds, but there is a sprawling, orange Hot Wheels track, where I stand on top of a ladder and send a silvery, die-cast toy car whizzing through the lobby. In a nearby chemistry lab, a machine slowly mixes sparkly goo. I pick up a plastic pony and dip it into water\u2014it changes from pink to yellow. So this is where the magic happens.<\/p>\n<p>This warehouse isn\u2019t actually a factory; the majority of Mattel toys are manufactured abroad. The Design Center is for conceptualizing, developing, and testing new versions of the flagship brands that have been around almost since the company began. That\u2019s one reason that, even in its colorful cacophony, the center feels stuck in time. One of the first things I notice is the separation between girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 toys. Exactly half of the 200,000-square-foot floor is devoted to Barbie and other \u201cgirl brands\u201d like spooky-doll line Monster High. There are rows and rows of Barbies on shelves and in employees\u2019 cubicles, many of which are partitioned with frilly white curtains. One disconcerting display showcases dozens of Barbie heads\u2014just the heads\u2014stuck on top of perfectly arranged spokes like so many Barbie-headed lollipops, showing off the variations of their hairstyles. The other side of the building is devoted to \u201cboys\u2019 toys,\u201d mainly Hot Wheels but also brawny WWE figurines. The juxtaposition\u2014muscle cars and muscled-up action figures on one side and hyper-feminine dolls on the other\u2014seems outdated, if not downright out of touch.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-medium-width aligncenter\" style=\"max-width:450px;\" ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-barbiedesign.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2160682\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/mattel-ceo-most-powerful-women\/mat-10-01-17-barbiedesign\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-barbiedesign.jpg?w=450&#038;h=589\" data-orig-size=\"1278,1674\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;7.1&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Angie Smith for FORTUNE&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 5D Mark II&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1505390020&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;35&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;250&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.025&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;MAT.10.01.17.barbiedesign&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"MAT.10.01.17.barbiedesign\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-barbiedesign.jpg?w=450&#038;h=589?w=229\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-barbiedesign.jpg?w=450&#038;h=589?w=782\" class=\"wp-image-2160682\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-barbiedesign.jpg?w=450&#038;h=589\" alt=\"MAT.10.01.17.barbiedesign\" width=\"450\" height=\"589\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-barbiedesign.jpg?w=450&amp;h=589 450w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-barbiedesign.jpg?w=900&amp;h=1178 900w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-barbiedesign.jpg?w=115&amp;h=150 115w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-barbiedesign.jpg?w=229&amp;h=300 229w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-barbiedesign.jpg?w=768&amp;h=1006 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-barbiedesign.jpg?w=782&amp;h=1024 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">A staffer works on Barbie clothing at Mattel\u2019s Design Center in El Segundo, Calif.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Angie Smith for FORTUNE<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>In both its gender dichotomy and its old-school, siloed feel, the Design Center shows how much Mattel needs to play catch-up. \u201cI really applaud the efforts Mattel has made to update Barbie,\u201d says Debbie Sterling, founder and CEO of STEM toy startup Goldieblox. \u201cBut there\u2019s a real challenge around the legacy of Barbie and what she stands for.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Oakland-based Goldieblox sells games that teach building and early engineering skills, with a focus on attracting girls. It\u2019s one of many toy upstarts that are steadfastly steering clear of gender stereotypes. Another Bay Area toy newbie, Wonder Workshop, builds turquoise-and-orange robots used by kids who are learning to program. To date, the company has shipped more than 300,000 of its bulbous \u201cDash\u201d robots\u2014marketed to boys and girls alike\u2014that scoot around according to simple instructions programmed by kids. And New York\u2013based LittleBits is also being gender&#8211;neutral in selling its inventor kits that enable kids to build and control robots. The company got a licensing deal with Lucasfilm after participating in an accelerator run by its parent company, Walt Disney. Its latest product? A build-it-yourself version of iconic droid R2-D2.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Regardless of what they make, toy startups have an advantage that Mattel, Hasbro, and Lego lack: They can start supply chains and distribution models from scratch. That means they can \u201cfail fast,\u201d testing products with the rapidity of a tech company, and tap e-commerce and digital advertising instead of breaking into bricks and mortar and shelling out millions for TV ads. In all these ways, the startups are much farther down a road that Big Toy is still scouting out.<\/p>\n<p>The toy giants know they need to take a tech-centric approach to product development and shed their more cumbersome production processes. \u201cWe have added complexity into the organization which now in turn makes it harder for us to grow further,\u201d Lego\u2019s executive chairman J\u00f8rgen Vig Knudstorp acknowledged in a news release announcing the company\u2019s recent layoffs. \u201cWe have now pressed the reset button.\u201d In August, the company ousted its CEO and appointed a new leader, Niels Christiansen, the former head of engineering company Danfoss\u2014hiring a techie outsider in an unprecedented move for the family-owned company.<\/p>\n<p>Like Mattel and Lego, Hasbro is hitting a wall; analysts expect revenue growth to slow from 13% in 2016 to just 3% in 2018, and its stock is down almost 20% from its highs this summer. As investors lose faith in its movie tie-ins, Hasbro is stretching in unfamiliar, screen-based directions. The company recently announced that its first Netflix series, <i>Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,<\/i> will launch in late 2017. That\u2019s a move that\u2019s simultaneously new (a show on a streaming service!) and old-fashioned (the original Stretch Armstrong doll was a hit upon its debut\u2014in 1976).<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>Toy Titans Retool<\/h2>\n<p><em>Here\u2019s how the three biggest companies in the traditional toy industry are adapting to a digital age.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Mattel<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>HQ:<\/strong> El Segundo, Calif.<br \/>\n<strong>2016 revenue:<\/strong> $5.5 Billion (\u20134% from 2015)<\/p>\n<p>The Hot Wheels maker is developing tech \u201cplatforms\u201d like natural language processing to use across multiple toy lines. Leading the charge are Google-trained CEO Margo Georgiadis and chief technology officer Sven Gerjets, a former CIO of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/time-warner\/\" target=\"_blank\">Time Warner<\/a> Cable. The tech-centric approach is new at Mattel, which still makes about $1 billion a year from a very analog product: Barbie dolls.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lego<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>HQ:<\/strong> Billund, Denmark<br \/>\n<strong>2016 revenue:<\/strong> $5.4 billion (+6% from 2015)<\/p>\n<p>Lego\u2019s new CEO, Niels Christiansen, wants to simplify and speed up the company\u2019s business processes, while bridging the gap between physical building blocks and digital 0s and 1s. After a strong decade, Lego\u2019s growth has significantly tapered off, leading the company to eliminate 1,400 jobs and hire Christiansen, who comes from an engineering and manufacturing background.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hasbro<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>HQ:<\/strong> Pawtucket, R.I.<br \/>\n<strong>2016 revenue:<\/strong> $5 billion (+13% from 2015)<\/p>\n<p>Even Play-Doh got a tech makeover at Hasbro, owner of brands like Monopoly and Easy-Bake Oven. Last year it launched an app that digitizes Play-Doh creations, allowing kids to interact with their sculpted dinosaurs and kittens on a screen. Still, much of Hasbro\u2019s growth comes from traditional toys that build on license agreements with the likes of Disney\u2019s Lucasfilm.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>But no big toymaker is making a bigger tech bet than Mattel. Georgiadis wants Mattel to emulate the speed and efficiency of Silicon Valley. That\u2019s why she\u2019s asked the company\u2019s head of supply chain to rely on fewer vendors, and why she\u2019s asked all executives to follow her \u201cRule of Two,\u201d which allows just two senior execs to make a decision (before Georgiadis, it usually took four or five). It\u2019s also why utilizing customer data in toy development is such an urgent project.<\/p>\n<p>Retooling Mattel could take many more years, of course\u2014especially given the typical 18-month concept-to-market cycle in the industry. Georgiadis says she had a modest hand in this year\u2019s holiday toy lineup, most of which was already under development when she joined the company.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, she\u2014and her competitors\u2014will still be able to draw inspiration from the pre-digital past. In one corner of Mattel\u2019s Design Center, I come face to face with some real magic: A machine that once made reels for View-Masters, the bright red 3D \u201cstereoscopes\u201d\u2014invented in 1939\u2014that many of us grew up with. This clunky apparatus, which operated for seven decades at a plant in Mexico, isn\u2019t much to look at. But it likely helped instill awe and wonder in thousands or millions of children worldwide.<\/p>\n<p>In 2015, Mattel struck a partnership with Google to bring the toy back to life with a techie twist. The \u201cView-Master Virtual Reality Viewer\u201d was built on the search company\u2019s Cardboard VR platform, and was applauded for bringing VR technology to younger audiences at an affordable price. Georgiadis\u2019s mission is to create product platforms that kindle similar magic\u2014but with the staying power of Barbie and Hot Wheels.<\/p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appears in the Oct. 1, 2017 issue of Fortune with the headline &#8220;Tech Takeover in Toyland.&#8221; <\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 22, 2017","published":"2017-09-22 06:30:25","updated":"2017-09-22 06:30:25","minute":"6:30 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/mattel-ceo-most-powerful-women\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/mattel-ceo-most-powerful-women\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/mattel-ceo-most-powerful-women\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Can a Tech Makeover Save the Toy Industry?","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-margo.jpg?w=407","class":"featured-img-article_portrait","credit":"Angie Smith for FORTUNE","caption":"Rewiring the Dreamhouse: Margo Georgiadis, a Google veteran, became Mattel\u2019s CEO in February.

The decision gives the Trump Administration the power to issue steep tariffs on Chinese companies\u2014where the majority are made\u2014cutting off the flow of cheap panels to installers in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>The upshot? Solar panel costs could rise for homeowners and businesses, forcing installation companies to potentially cut jobs, industry groups and analysts argue.<\/p>\n<p>In April, manufacturer <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/08\/15\/us-solar-energy-tariffs-panels\/\">Suniva petitioned the ITC<\/a>\u2014nine days after the company sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection\u2014arguing that an influx of cheap panels made it impossible for them to compete. SolarWorld supported its petition. Suniva has requested that solar cells brought into the United States have a 40-cent tariff. The company wants solar panels to have a minimum price of 78 cents a watt, which is two-thirds more expensive than the cheapest panels on the market.<\/p>\n<p>Suniva, which makes panels in Georgia and Michigan, is owned by Hong Kong-based Shunfeng International Clean Energy since 2015. SolarWorld is a German manufacturer that has a subsidiary based in Oregon.<\/p>\n<p>Tesla, which owns SolarCity, said its project will continue regardless of the final outcome.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTesla is currently building the largest solar cell and module plant in the U.S., and we are committed to expanding our domestic manufacturing with or without any tariff or price guarantees, a Tesla spokewoman said.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The issue has split the solar industry. On one side are a few solar manufacturers like Suniva and SolarWorld that say low-cost imports have made it impossible to be profitable. On the other side is the U.S. solar installation industry, which has benefited from low-cost panels that have led to explosive growth in rooftop systems on homes and commercial buildings as well as massive solar farms.<\/p>\n<p>This boom in installations and solar farm construction has helped create thousands of jobs. U.S. solar industry employed 260,077 workers last year, a nearly 25% increase in the number of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/02\/07\/us-solar-jobs-2016\/\">solar jobs<\/a> between 2015 and 2016\u2014a jump largely driven by a massive increase in solar panel installations, according to a report released in February by the non-profit solar advocacy group <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thesolarfoundation.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Solar Foundation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But now, analysts and the Solar Energy Industries Association say tariffs threaten to gut the industry.<\/p>\n<p>Suniva&#8217;s remedy proposal will double the price of solar, destroy two-thirds of demand, erode billions of dollars in investment and and unnecessarily force 88,000 Americans to lose their jobs in 2018, SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said in a statement citing analysts&#8217; forecasts.<\/p>\n<p>This could even impact U.S. taxpayers who help pay for tax credits used to encourage Americans to use more clean energy. This could mean U.S. taxpayers will pay as much as $1.23 billion more, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/about.bnef.com\/blog\/imposing-solar-tariffs-may-cost-u-s-taxpayers-1-23-billion\/\">Bloomberg

giant has shut down its Project Alloy virtual reality headset initiative, in which third-party companies were to build VR headsets based on Intel\u2019s hardware blueprints, according to a report published Friday by tech publication <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roadtovr.com\/intel-scraps-plans-to-launch-project-alloy-reference-headset-pursuing-other-vrar-rd\/\">Road to VR<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Instead,

But for many states, the calls Friday from the Department of Homeland Security were the first official confirmation of whether their states were on the list.<\/p>\n<p>The AP contacted every state election office on Friday. While not all of them responded immediately, those that said they were targeted were Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.<\/p>\n<p>The government did not say who was behind the hacking attempts or provide details about what had been sought. But election officials in three states said Friday the attempts could be linked to Russia.<\/p>\n<p>The Wisconsin Election Commission, for example, said the state&#8217;s systems were targeted by &#8220;Russian government cyber actors.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Federal officials said that in most of the 21 states, the targeting was preparatory activity such as scanning computer systems. The targets included voter registration systems but not vote tallying software. Officials said there were some attempts to compromise networks but most were unsuccessful.<\/p>\n<p>Only Illinois reported that hackers had succeeded in breaching its voter systems.<\/p>\n<p>Colorado said the hacking wasn&#8217;t quite a breach.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really reconnaissance by a bad guy to try and figure out how we would break into your computer,&#8221; said Trevor Timmons, a spokesman for the Colorado secretary of state&#8217;s office. &#8220;It&#8217;s not an attack. I wouldn&#8217;t call it a probe. It&#8217;s not a breach, it&#8217;s not a penetration.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The disclosure to the states comes as a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/08\/31\/mueller-new-york-attorney-general-cooperate-on-manafort-probe\/\">special counsel probes<\/a> whether there was any coordination during the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/21\/mark-zuckerberg-outlines-facebooks-plan-to-fight-russian-election-hacking\/\">2016 presidential campaign<\/a> between Russia and associates of Donald Trump.<\/p>\n<p>Trump, a Republican who defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential election, has called the Russia story a hoax.

for an independent investigation <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/21\/sec-hack-edgar\/\">into a cyber breach<\/a> at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and urged the regulator to delay new data-gathering rules until it could assure investors that its computer systems were secure.<\/p>\n<p>Wall Street&#8217;s top regulator came under fire on Thursday after admitting hackers had breached its database of corporate announcements in 2016 and might have used it for insider trading.<\/p>\n<p>The Investment Company Institute (ICI), which represents over 95 million U.S. shareholders, wants the SEC to clear up concerns about its cyber defenses before requiring funds to submit monthly performance data to the regulator, Paul Schott Stevens, the group&#8217;s chief executive, told Reuters in a phone interview.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What the SEC breach now makes very clear is precisely what we were concerned about &#8211; that market-sensitive information of that nature can be exploited to the disadvantage of millions and millions of investors,&#8221; Stevens said.<\/p>\n<p>ICI, whose shareholders have $20 trillion plus in assets, has raised concerns about how the SEC safeguarded industry data it gathers since 2015.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m certain there will be a full inquiry by the Government of Accountability Office &#8211; and there should be, so we understand exactly what happened here,&#8221; Stevens said.<\/p>\n<p>In a July report, the Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/21\/sec-hacking-vulnerabilities-u-s-government\/\">criticized the SEC for failing to fully protect<\/a> its computer networks from cyber attacks and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/21\/sec-hacked-homeland-security\/\">recommended a slew of improvements<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Former SEC Chair Mary Jo White, in office when the hack occurred, told Reuters in 2016 that cyber security posed the biggest risk to the U.S. financial system.<\/p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https:\/\/pages.email.fortune.com\/newsletters\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Get Data Sheet<\/a>, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Her successor, Jay Clayton, uncovered the full extent of the hack after launching a review of the SEC&#8217;s cybersecurity standards earlier this year.<\/p>\n<p>The SEC declined to comment.<\/p>\n<p>New reporting rules which start to come into force in December would require funds for the first time to confidentially file complete monthly portfolio holdings with the SEC, data which the ICI has said could easily be used for insider trading if obtained by hackers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Until that information security environment has been established, funds should continue to collect data quarterly, not monthly information, as quarterly data is not nearly as sensitive,&#8221; said Stevens.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 22, 2017","published":"2017-09-22 06:31:56","updated":"2017-09-22 06:31:56","minute":"6:31 PM

But it&#8217;s still early for a lot of the activities, so what can you do? Here are five ways to make the most of your first fall weekend.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Buy your pumpkin now.<\/h3>\n<p>Not to start off autumn with an alarm, but if the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/11\/26\/thanksgiving-pumpkin-shortage\/\">Great Thanksgiving Pumpkin Shortage of 2015<\/a> is any indicator, you may want to buy your pumpkin early this year. In October 2015, it appeared there would be a pumpkin shortage by Thanksgiving, due to higher-than-normal rainfall during June&#8217;s growing season in Morton, Ill., where approximately 85% of the country&#8217;s orange squashes come from. That caused a panic, though eventually everyone got their fill.<\/p>\n<p>Last year <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/09\/25\/2016-pumpkin-crop\/\">the crop rebounded nicely<\/a>, but this year, Morton&#8217;s rainfall is higher than it was in 2016, (though less than it was in 2015). The long and short of it is this: Buy your grocery store pumpkins sooner rather than later, unless you&#8217;re out of your gourd. (Note: Technically speaking, pumpkins aren&#8217;t gourds.)<\/p>\n<h3>2. Plant next summer\u2019s lawn today.<\/h3>\n<p>Want the neighbors to be green with envy over your grass next summer? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scotts.com\/en-us\/library\/lawn-basics\/important-lawn-maintenance-projects-fall\">Start putting in the work today<\/a>, say the lawn wranglers over at Scotts. The best way to ensure that your grass remains healthy, strong, and well established come summertime is to begin working on it in autumn.<\/p>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t already, start by feeding your grass, something that ideally you should&#8217;ve been done in early September. Once that&#8217;s done and absorbed into the soil, reseed your lawn to patch all the holes left behind after a summer of hard playing in the yard. Then, a month or two after the first feeding, you&#8217;ll want to give the grass another dose of fertilizer to carry it through the colder months. The air may only be a little crisp at the moment, but as they say in <em>Game of Thrones, <\/em>&#8220;Winter is coming.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>3. Be first to the pumpkin patch.<\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re one for picking your own pumpkin, plan to get there before the crowds because\u2014and not to sound like an overbearing parent here\u2014there will be crowds. That means pack the car the night before, wake up and leave early, make sure you have snacks and water, and be ready for traffic, because parking at u-pick farms can be scarier than anything you&#8217;ll see at Halloween.<\/p>\n<p>That said, there are a lot of patches to hit, just visit <a href=\"http:\/\/pumpkinpatchguide.com\/\">The Pumpkin Patch Guide<\/a> to find one near you. And if you&#8217;re not going to be first, at least be well prepared by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Mac-Sports-Collapsible-Folding-Outdoor\/dp\/B00BUUUIGK\">buying a collapsable outdoor utility wagon<\/a>, which is great for hauling pumpkins, toddlers, or both.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Plan for peak fall foliage.<\/h3>\n<p>Optimal leaf-peeping time isn&#8217;t yet upon us, but if you want to sneak a peak at the current conditions near you or around the country, The Weather Channel has rolled out its <a href=\"https:\/\/weather.com\/maps\/fall-foliage\">Fall Foliage Maps for 2017<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As of this writing, (and depending on where you&#8217;re reading this from) the scenery still looks sparse. But you can forecast when the <a href=\"https:\/\/smokymountains.com\/fall-foliage-map\/\">colors will begin to pop<\/a> in your area using this guide from The Smoky Mountains. Keep in mind, the website notes, &#8220;While no tool can be 100% accurate, this tool is meant to help travelers better time their trips to have the best opportunity of catching peak color each year.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>5. Enjoy pumpkin spice everything.<\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of Starbuck&#8217;s pumpkin spice lattes, you already know the Seattle-based coffee chain has been <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/08\/10\/starbucks-pumpkin-spice-latte-2\/\">pushing their signature fall drink<\/a> since August. (And if you&#8217;re not, you can cozy up to their new alternative, the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/21\/starbucks-new-flavor-maple-pecan-latte\/\">maple pecan latte<\/a>.) But there&#8217;s more, like Krispy Kreme doughnuts (sorry, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/05\/krispy-kreme-pumpkin-doughnut-one-day-only\/\">you missed them<\/a>), <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/08\/25\/pumpkin-flavors-earlier\/\">craft beer<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/20\/pumpkin-spice-cheerios\/\">Cheerios<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/pumpkin-spice-pizza\/\">pizza<\/a> of course, and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/14\/pumpkin-spice-spray\/\">even body spray<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>With all these products, it begs the question: Why are we <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/08\/starbucks-pumpkin-spice-latte-obsession\/\">so obsessed with pumpkin spice?<\/a> Sadly, no one has time to answer. They&#8217;re all too busy consuming pumpkin spice everything.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 22, 2017","published":"2017-09-22 05:56:03","updated":"2017-09-22 05:56:03","minute":"5:56 PM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/first-day-of-fall-what-to-do-this-weekend\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/first-day-of-fall-what-to-do-this-weekend\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/first-day-of-fall-what-to-do-this-weekend\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"First Day of Fall: What to Do This Weekend","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/gettyimages-623127076.jpg?w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Getty Images\/iStockphoto","caption":"Sunset over a grassy field with hundreds of pumpkins laid out as far as the eye can see.","attach_id":"2162335"},"excerpt":"Celebrate the 2017 autumn equinox with these five fun fall tips.","authors":[{"id":"462404","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/john-patrick-pullen\/","name":"John Patrick Pullen","twitter":"jppullen","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/pullen.png?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/pullen.png?w=59 59w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/pullen.png?w=118 118w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 59px) 100vw, 59px\" data-attachment-id=\"2139857\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/?attachment_id=2139857\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/pullen.png\" data-orig-size=\"200,200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"pullen\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/pullen.png?w=200\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/pullen.png?w=200\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/pullen.png?w=150",150,150,true],"bio":"John Patrick Pullen has been contributing to <em>Fortune<\/em> since 2010, writing frequently about technology.","title":"","company":"","is_contributor":"not-contributor"}],"sections":[{"term_id":384,"name":"Entertainment","slug":"entertainment","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":130744,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News about the business of entertainment, including the music, film and TV industries, as well as the celebrities and people who work in them.

It Will Only Make Recovery Harder","content":"<p>With six dead, millions of residents facing months without electricity, and far-flung relatives desperately trying to contact their loved ones, Puerto Rico is only just beginning to grapple with the fallout from Hurricane Maria, the strongest storm the island has faced in nearly a century. Looming over those recovery efforts is a vital question: Who will foot the bill for the estimated $10 billion in damages?<\/p>\n<p>The answer would be complicated enough for a financially healthy Puerto Rico. But the island&#8217;s economy was in shambles well before Hurricane Maria ever formed. Puerto Rico declared a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/05\/03\/business\/dealbook\/puerto-rico-debt.html?mcubz=3\">form of bankruptcy<\/a> in May, facing a crushing multi-billion dollar debt load following years of financial mismanagement. For the last decade, the government hasn&#8217;t had the funds to repay its creditors or improve its aging infrastructure, let alone deal with the ramifications of a major hurricane.<\/p>\n<p>Officials are taking some steps to address the problem. The Commonwealth has been allowed by a federally organized task force overseeing its economy to reassign $1 billion from its current budget to emergency response and repair, according to its largest daily newspaper, <a href=\"https:\/\/protect-us.mimecast.com\/s\/LL0LBJiRdae4uK?domain=elnuevodia.com\">El Nuevo Dia<\/a>. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has approved additional federal disaster assistance.<\/p>\n<p>But experts say that may not be enough.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">n general, the disaster relief system is structured so people are meant to rely on their private insurance,<\/span>&#8221; says Professor James Kendra, director of the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware. Through FEMA, for example, individuals can only receive a maximum of $33,300\u2014hardly enough to rebuild a house, especially in Puerto Rico where just about 50% of houses in the territory are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/hurricane-maria-exposes-a-common-problem-for-puerto-rico-homeowners-no-insurance-1505940660\">covered by insurance<\/a>. How and to what degree Puerto Rico will fund repairs for essential public facilities, such as the bankrupt power authority, also remains unclear.<\/p>\n<p>Further complicating matters is that Puerto Rico&#8217;s economic history will limit its fundraising options. With $74 billion in debt and $49 billion in unfunded public pensions, the island has no access to capital markets. Even if it did, willing investors would be hard to find \u2014 Puerto Rico&#8217;s current bondholders are already nervous that Hurricane Maria will make it tougher for them to collect on their repayments, as the expected post-Maria tourism drought will mean in lost tax revenue.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Puerto Rico has exhausted its financial resources,&#8221; says Hernando Montero Salazar, director of Credit Analyisis at Stoever Glass &amp; Co. &#8220;That will leave them strictly with the options of the federal government to provide aid and restore infrastructure. That&#8217;s the only way Puerto Rico will be able to put themselves together.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Yet Puerto Rico may find it difficult to appeal to Congress, where, as a U.S. territory, it has no voting power. Additionally, lawmakers there have long chastised Puerto Rico for the mismanagement that led to its bankruptcy \u2014 particularly the fiscal conservatives who currently control the legislative branch. And even though its finances are now largely in the hands of the federal task force, the island&#8217;s track record could make it harder to officials to ask for more money. &#8220;With a Republican majority, they could attack [too large a package] as part of a bailout,&#8221; says Amilcar Barreto, an associate professor at Northeastern University.<\/p>\n<p>Even if Puerto Rico gets the money it needs to rebuild over the next few months, its long-term prospects remain grim. Unlike Houston, which had a flourishing economy when Hurricane Harvey hit, Puerto Rico has been struggling for years. The Commonwealth&#8217;s woes can be traced back to 2006, when a tax break for U.S. companies expired. An exodus of jobs soon followed, with the unemployment rate reaching over 12% earlier this year, more than double the overall U.S. figure. As the jobs left, people began to follow. The island&#8217;s population has shrunk to about 3.5 million from 3.8 million in 2000.<\/p>\n<p>Hurricane Maria could accelerate that trend, says Amilcar Barreto, an associate professor at Northeastern University. With the power authority predicting months of outages, Puerto Ricans may continue to flee the island, making it even harder for it to regain economic steam. &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">For many businesses, dealing with a fiscal crisis was bad enough,<\/span>&#8221; says Barreto. &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">I question whether or not good will be good enough.<\/span>&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>If there&#8217;s any silver lining, it&#8217;s that seeing images of the devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria could push lawmakers in Washington to open the coffers. That could help rebuild critical infrastructure, get the power back on, and start the long slog towards recovery. &#8220;There will an economic black hole for a good part of the year,&#8221; predicts John Mousseau, the director of fixed income at money management firm Cumberland Advisors. &#8220;[But] if you get this rebuilding underway, you start seeing Puerto Rico turning the other way.&#8221;<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 22, 2017","published":"2017-09-22 06:15:09","updated":"2017-09-22 06:15:09","minute":"6:15 PM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-help-recovery\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-help-recovery\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-help-recovery\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Puerto Rico's Economy Was a Mess Well Before Hurricane Maria.

The latest watch includes standalone cellular data connectivity for the first time, meaning it can be used to make phone calls without an iPhone nearby.<\/p>\n<p>Chayce O&#8217;Neal, 27, said he had come to buy the new watch and wasn&#8217;t discouraged by reviews that mentioned connectivity problems. But he was skipping the iPhone 8 and holding out for the iPhone X.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I like being on top of the cutting edge of technology,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Indifferent reviews of the iPhone 8, which comes 10 years after<span class=\"highlight\"> Apple <\/span>released the first version of the revolutionary phone, drove down shares of the company to near two-month lows of $152.75 on Thursday, as investors worried <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/19\/apple-iphone-8-preorders-disappoint\/\">pre-orders for the device had come in well below previous launches<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The iPhone 8 will only cater to those who want a new version but do not want to pay a hefty $999 for the iPhone X, said iTWire.com&#8217;s technology editor Alex Zaharov-Reutt, who did not line up for the launch.<\/p>\n<p>That was the case for Damien Roberts, a customer in line at<span class=\"highlight\"> Apple<\/span>&#8216;s San Francisco store. Roberts owns a battered iPhone 6s and wanted an <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/18\/sprint-free-iphone-8\/\">upgrade to the iPhone 8 Plus<\/a> for phone calls, messages and playing his favorite video game &#8220;Clash of Clans.&#8221; He said he didn&#8217;t need the extra features of the $999 iPhone X.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lot of money to shell out for a phone,&#8221; said Roberts, a Briton who was purchasing the phone while on vacation.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking to CNBC,<span class=\"highlight\"> Apple <\/span>Chief Executive Tim Cook said the<span class=\"highlight\"> Apple <\/span>Watch with cellular data service is &#8220;sold out in so many places around the world&#8221; and iPhone 8 models were also sold out. He did not specify the locations he was referring to.<\/p>\n<p>The iPhone X is a glass and stainless steel device with an edge-to-edge display that Cook has called &#8220;the biggest leap forward

Less than a week after the company was in California opposing a law to protect online privacy, Facebook was in Washington saying it could not reveal information about Russian interference with the election because of privacy laws. And then this week it decided it could cooperate with investigators. Talk about a change in privacy settings!<\/p>\n<p>As a privacy advocate, I normally stand up for companies that stand up for user privacy. In the hi-tech world, we need these firms to oppose broad government requests for personal data and to build strong privacy safeguards into their products. But Facebook is not protecting the privacy of its users when it stonewalls the public about the role of Russia in the 2016 election. Instead, it is hiding its business practices\u2014and that\u2019s a problem.<\/p>\n<p>There is little doubt that Russia targeted social media with the goal of influencing the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The unclassified portion of a report prepared by the Office of Director National Intelligence (DNI) in January describes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dni.gov\/files\/documents\/ICA_2017_01.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Russia\u2019s multi-pronged attack<\/a>, including spreading online propaganda on Facebook. But the public needs the full story. Earlier this year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.epic.org\/foia\/odni\/russian-hacking\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">my organization<\/a> sued the DNI under the Freedom of Information Act for release of the complete January report. <a href=\"http:\/\/thehill.com\/blogs\/pundits-blog\/the-administration\/325862-americans-have-a-right-to-know-what-intel-community\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">We want to know<\/a> what the government knows about Russian meddling. But we don\u2019t have the ability to uncover Facebook\u2019s records. That is a role for Congress.<\/p>\n<p>Mark Zuckerberg seems to be listening. This week the Facebook CEO announced changes in advertising practices that would improve transparency and make clear the sources of political ads run on the social media network. This is a step in the right direction.<\/p>\n<p>But Facebook still needs to operate under the same rules that govern other media companies that sell political advertising. If the goal is to ensure fair and accountable elections, the Internet cannot be a Federal Elections Commission-free zone. This week members of Congress <a href=\"https:\/\/www.recode.net\/2017\/9\/20\/16340410\/facebook-google-political-ads-russia-fec-letter-democrats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">urged the FEC in a letter<\/a> to update advertising laws to prevent foreign governments from using online advertising platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to influence voters.<\/p>\n<p>That letter came just two weeks after Facebook admitted that it sold more than 3,000 ads to the \u201cInternet Research Agency,\u201d a troll farm that spreads propaganda in support of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his allies and goes after his enemies. Political ads on most U.S. media are required to state their sources and funding. But the Russian troll farm hid behind Facebook\u2019s anonymous algorithms\u2014a practice that would have violated the law had it been done in print or on television.<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t have much sympathy for Facebook\u2019s shifting privacy arguments. But if the company, Congress, and the FEC can work together and prevent online election fraud, that will be good news for Internet users and U.S. voters.<\/p>\n<p><em>Marc Rotenberg is president of

That\u2019s what I like.<\/p>\n<p>The industry is seeing a pace of change and disruption that we\u2019ve never seen, even coming out of the financial crisis. It is changing in enormous ways. You\u2019re going to have consolidation, disruption, and a shakeout in the industry.

But we don\u2019t want to give up that growth. So we have been moving our product line to create natural, organic, and GMO-free products.<\/p>\n<p>Could we do more? Yes, but I worry about the availability of the raw materials. Being a large company, if we say something is organic, it better be organic. The labeling has very high standards. If anything, it\u2019s a supply-chain challenge.<\/p>\n<p><b>Research clearly shows people are wary of aspartame as a sweetener. But when you replaced it with sucralose in Diet Pepsi, consumers didn\u2019t bite. What happened? <\/b><\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a slight taste difference. It\u2019s not a degradation. It\u2019s slightly different. So what\u2019s the problem? This was my biggest puzzle, to be honest.<\/p>\n<p>What consumers think of as healthy is not always science-based. It\u2019s perception, what your friends told you, what the newest story is on the blogs or social media. Some of it might not be based on facts. If you look at potato chips in Whole Foods, they\u2019re not any healthier than Lay\u2019s. In fact I would say Lay\u2019s is even higher quality than what they sell. But just because it comes in a brown bag, people pay extra, thinking it is maybe natural, organic, or handmade. This is the reality of today, and we have to figure out how to market in these new times.<\/p>\n<p><b>Is there a new category you want to get into?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s more about categories that are ripe for disruption. I\u2019ll give you an example: hot beverages. It\u2019s been coffee and tea forever. It hasn\u2019t been disrupted yet. But you go to many local cultures, they drink a lot of other hot beverages. I have to light a creative spark here to get people to think differently. Don\u2019t start with coffee or tea. What\u2019s the best hot beverage that should be sold between November and March that\u2019s totally different, that\u2019s awesome, that people drink and go, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I think about this before?\u201d That\u2019s a space I think is ripe for harvesting, or for a Travis Kalanick or a Brian Chesky to walk in.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/noo10_b.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2158570\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/21\/most-powerful-women-pepsico-indra-nooyi\/president-trump-holds-policy-forum-with-business-leaders-7\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/noo10_b.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" data-orig-size=\"2880,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Chip Somodevilla&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS-1D X Mark II&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 03:  U.S. President Donald Trump (2nd R) delivers opening remarks at the beginning of a policy forum with (L-R) PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi, Blackstone Group Chairman and CEO Stephen Schwarzman, General Motors CEO Mary Barra and other business leaders in the State Dining Room at the White House February 3, 2017 in Washington, DC.

But you also sat on President Trump\u2019s business advisory \u00adcouncil\u2014and were criticized for not stepping down from the group before it was disbanded in the wake of his comments about the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. How do you think about these political issues?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Until the election happens, you can support any candidate you want. There was a candidate that represented the values that I liked, but the day after the election, whoever is elected President is my President. And I congratulated him on that. And even today, he is our President.<\/p>\n<p>It was a well-thought-through idea to get these councils together to help the President debate and discuss certain issues. The political cycle operates in short cycles. The issues and resolutions are long cycles. This is where business can straddle the two.<\/p>\n<p>I think in this case, perhaps some of the comments that had been made post-Charlottesville did create some consternation. If individual CEOs take action, it\u2019s not good for anybody\u2014then each of us becomes a media story. It\u2019s not a decision any of us took lightly, but circumstances demanded that we step down as a group.<\/p>\n<p><b>What went wrong with the Kendall Jenner protest ad, which received a lot of criticism? <\/b><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve thought about it a lot because I looked at the ad again and again and again trying to figure out what went wrong\u2014because it was a peace march not a protest march. It was people in happiness coming together. I realized the scene that caused the most consternation was the final one, when Kendall Jenner gave a Pepsi to the policeman, and it linked back to Black Lives Matter.<\/p>\n<p>This has pained me a lot because this company is known for diversity, and the fact that everybody who produced the commercial and approved the commercial did not link it to Black Lives Matter made me scratch my head. I had not seen that scene. And I take everything personally. The minute I saw people upset, I pulled it. And you know what, it\u2019s not worth it. There were people on both sides, but at the end of the day, our goal is not to offend anybody.<\/p>\n<p><b>What advice would you give women entering the workforce today?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Everybody has to enter the workforce knowing it\u2019s a long journey. For women, know your journey is going to be tougher because you have so many other priorities to worry about. Today people would argue that men have the same priorities. Yes, but women were born with an extra gene that makes us worry about those things just a little bit more. I don\u2019t know why\u2014societal or genetic\u2014but we worry about the family, the husband, evening\u2019s dinner, yesterday morning\u2019s breakfast, aging parents.<\/p>\n<p>Because we have so many issues to worry about we have to compartmentalize even better. We have to develop more skills to write lists and learn how to prioritize. If you don\u2019t know how to do it, go to a course to learn how to do it. I make a list every day of 50, 60 items, and I tick off what I\u2019ve done\u2014tiny things. If I\u2019m carrying two to three items over to the next day, it feels great. People say multitasking isn\u2019t very good. If I didn\u2019t multitask, I have no idea how I\u2019d survive.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Subscribe to the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getbroadsheet\/\">Broadsheet<\/a>, Fortune\u2019s daily newsletter on the world\u2019s most powerful women.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appears in the Oct. 1, 2017 issue of Fortune with the headline &#8220;Queen of Pop.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 21, 2017","published":"2017-09-21 06:30:39","updated":"2017-09-21 06:30:39","minute":"6:30 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/21\/most-powerful-women-pepsico-indra-nooyi\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/21\/most-powerful-women-pepsico-indra-nooyi\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/21\/most-powerful-women-pepsico-indra-nooyi\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"PepsiCo\u2019s CEO Opens Up About Trump, Amazon, and That Kendall Jenner Ad","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/indra-nooyi-pepsi.jpg?w=800&h=488&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_must_reads_2x","credit":"Spencer Heyfron","caption":"PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi.","attach_id":2158580},"excerpt":"<p>Indra Nooyi is No. 2 on Fortune\u2019s 2017 Most Powerful Women list.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"381326","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/beth-kowitt\/","name":"Beth Kowitt","twitter":"bethkowitt","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=59 59w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=118 118w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 59px) 100vw, 59px\" data-attachment-id=\"1599149\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/kowitt\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png\" data-orig-size=\"200,200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"BETA HEADSHOTS 2016 \u2014 Beth Kowitt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=200\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=200\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=150",150,150,true],"bio":"Beth Kowitt is a senior writer at Fortune Magazine, where she covers food and agriculture, consumer behavior, and sustainability.

specifically as it relates to pre-existing conditions.<\/p>\n<p>Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) found the segment so moving, he publicly stated that any Republican-sponsored <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/05\/05\/politics\/senator-cassidy-health-bill-jimmy-kimmel-test-cnntv\/index.html\">Obamacare repeal bill<\/a> should pass the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/05\/15\/trumpcare-preexisting-conditions\/\">&#8220;Jimmy Kimmel test&#8221;<\/a> for Americans with pre-existing medical conditions. After the new &#8220;Graham-Cassidy&#8221; bill, co-sponsored by Cassidy, called those protections into question, Kimmel angrily <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/19\/graham-cassidy-jimmy-kimmel-pre-existing-conditions\/\">jumped back into the fray,<\/a> turning himself into a health care expert in the process.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday, he published a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KUH0KQ1qMiw&amp;feature=youtu.be\">seven-minute explainer<\/a> on the legislation, declaring that the \u201cbill most definitely does not pass [the Jimmy Kimmel] test.\u201d He ended with a literal call to action. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever to call your senators and tell them not to gut American health care,\u201d he said to wide applause.<\/p>\n<p>While Kimmel may be an unlikely policy expert, celebrities have long influenced how consumers <a href=\"https:\/\/systematicreviewsjournal.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13643-016-0395-1#Abs1\">make decisions regarding their health, <\/a>often expertly leveraging their fame to encourage people to take action.<\/p>\n<p>Below, five recent celebrities who have shaped the public conversation around health issues, sometimes for the better and sometimes&#8230;well, you&#8217;ll see.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Charlie Sheen announces he is HIV positive<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>After the controversial actor <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/11\/17\/charlie-sheen-hiv-positive-today-show\/\">announced<\/a> he was HIV-positive in 2015, a record number of people scrambled to get tested and learn their status. The \u201cCharlie Sheen Effect\u201d was verified by a study published in the journal <em><a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11121-017-0792-2\">Prevention Science<\/a><\/em>. John Ayers, who co-authored the study, said Sheen&#8217;s disclosure had an undeniable impact. \u201cOur new study shows not only did Sheen&#8217;s disclosure lead people to seek information about HIV prevention, it also corresponded with record levels of at-home rapid HIV testing sales,&#8221; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/05\/18\/health\/celebrity-health-charlie-sheen-study\/index.html\">he told CNN<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Angelina Jolie reveals her risk for breast and ovarian cancer<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>In a frank series of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/05\/14\/opinion\/my-medical-choice.html?mcubz=1\">op-eds<\/a>, Jolie opened up how learning she carried the BRCA1 mutation, which she said gave her an 87% risk of developing breast cancer and a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer, informed her health choices. After her doctors told her there was reason to believe she had an early form of the disease, Jolie opted for surgery in 2015 to remove her breasts, ovaries and fallopian tubes. Her disclosure opened up <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/contentfrom\/2015\/4\/17\/jolie-effect-preventive-surgery\/ntv_a\/5rQBA1IsCAfxgFA\/?prx_ro=s\">an important debate<\/a> about screening and prophylactic mastectomy. Since Jolie went public with her decision, studies have found a <a href=\"http:\/\/europepmc.org\/abstract\/med\/23947266\">dramatic uptick<\/a> in high-risk patient screenings for the genetic mutation.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Prince Harry opens up about his mental health<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>While it&#8217;s fun to speculate on the love life of the bachelor royal, Prince Harry inspired a different conversation earlier this year when he <a href=\"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/2017\/04\/16\/prince-harry-sought-counselling-death-mother-led-two-years-total\/\">spoke candidly about his struggles<\/a> with mental health following the death of his mother, Princess Diana. His decision to seek professional, he says, helped saved him. \u201cI was very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions,\u201d he told <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/2017\/04\/16\/prince-harry-sought-counselling-death-mother-led-two-years-total\/\">The Telegraph<\/a>. <\/em>Following Harry&#8217;s disclosure, which was part of a \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.headstogether.org.uk\/support\/\">national conversation about mental health<\/a>,\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/2017\/04\/22\/charities-hail-prince-harry-effect\/\">a record number of people<\/a> reached out for mental health evaluations and services.

This was particularly troubling, as the disease had been declared eradicated in 2000. The bulk of the infections could be traced back to an outbreak in Disneyland; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/science\/sciencenow\/la-sci-sn-disneyland-measles-under-vaccination-20150316-story.html\">Researchers later determined<\/a> that \u201cvaccine refusal\u201d was primarily to blame. Actress Jenny McCarthy is largely viewed as the <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/60416\/jenny-mccarthy-anti-vaccine-whitewash\/\">celebrity face<\/a> of the anti-vaccine movement, which spawned from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2009\/10\/ff_waronscience\/\">a now discredited study<\/a> that linked the MMR (measles\/mumps\/rubella) vaccine to autism. Let&#8217;s be clear: researchers have confirmed that such a connection does not exist, but that hasn&#8217;t stopped anti-vaccine activists from frightening parents for more than a decade.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Gwyneth Paltrow&#8217;s status as a wellness guru is unclear<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The Academy-award winning actress has used her fame to launch Goop, a lifestyle brand that offers New Age-y, mostly benign content and advice. Recently, however, Goop&#8217;s wellness claims have come under fire. This August, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.truthinadvertising.org\/tina-takes-goop-claims-to-regulators\/\">Truth in Advertising (TINA) announced<\/a> that it found &#8220;50 instances in which the company claims, either expressly or implicitly, that its products (or those it promotes) can treat, cure, prevent, alleviate the symptoms of, or reduce the risk of developing a number of ailments.\u201d Subscription-based supplements and stickers that claim to reduce anxiety were among the problematic products. Long before the controversy hit, Goop was peddling questionable health advice. For example, the company recommended a procedure known as \u201cvaginal steaming&#8221; that promised to \u201ccleanse your uterus.\u201d The site also sells expensive jade eggs that, when inserted into your vagina, are supposed to \u201cincrease vaginal muscle tone, hormonal balance, and feminine energy in general.\u201d The $66 item sold out, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/to-your-health\/wp\/2017\/01\/22\/no-gwyneth-paltrow-women-should-not-put-jade-eggs-in-their-vaginas-gynecologist-says\/?utm_term=.1f8ddb0049b0\">according to <em>The Washington Post,<\/em><\/a> though Dr. Jen Gunter, an OB\/GYN for Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco, told the<em> Post <\/em>the whole thing was \u201cthe biggest load of garbage.\u201d<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 22, 2017","published":"2017-09-22 04:11:08","updated":"2017-09-22 04:11:08","minute":"4:11 PM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/5-celebrities-who-have-shaped-our-understanding-of-health-for-better-and-for-worse\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/5-celebrities-who-have-shaped-our-understanding-of-health-for-better-and-for-worse\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/5-celebrities-who-have-shaped-our-understanding-of-health-for-better-and-for-worse\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"5 Celebrities Who Have Shaped Our Understanding of Health","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/842917988.jpg?w=800&h=488&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_must_reads_2x","credit":"AFP Contributor AFP\/Getty Images","caption":"(Photo credit should read TOBY MELVILLE\/AFP\/Getty Images)","attach_id":2162285},"excerpt":"<p>Some use their high-profile position for good.

Peltz, who&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/14\/procter-gamble-needs-nelson-peltz\/\">mounted a proxy battle<\/a> seeking a board seat at P&amp;G&#8217;s October 10 annual meeting, has fired back. P&amp;G&#8217;s newest broadside, charges Trian, is riddled with &#8220;material factual errors, data errors, calculation errors and misrepresentations of Trian&#8217;s and Nelson Peltz&#8217;s track records.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>While assessing P&amp;G&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/voteblue.pg.com\/?gclid=CjwKCAjw6ZLOBRALEiwAxzyCWydf-RMxI2MApGCIMeXk1TfFgkn8JvFbDqjYUUXyA-IkODvqQIhSdxoC090QAvD_BwE\">entire critique<\/a> would be a lengthy undertaking, this writer was intrigued by one of the major points in dispute. P&amp;G claims that this comparison with prominent rivals demonstrates Trian&#8217;s mediocre performance, and Trian counters that the P&amp;G&#8217;s calculations are marred by glaring errors, and show no such thing.<\/p>\n<p>After checking the numbers, my conclusion is that Trian is basically correct. P&amp;G needs to work on its math.<\/p>\n<p>On page 83 of its web presentation defending management&#8217;s performance and criticizing Peltz&#8217;s fitness as a director, P&amp;G displays a bar chart comparing the record of Trian holding Mondelez to rivals <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/hershey\/\" target=\"_blank\">Hershey<\/a> and Nestle from 2013 to 2016, based on &#8220;Adjusted Operating Margin.&#8221; That measure is apparently EBIT, or earnings before interest and taxes, because the 15.3% margin shown for Mondelez, and its 470 basis point improvement over the past three years, are the EBIT numbers reported in its 10K.<\/p>\n<p>According to the chart, Mondelez trailed Hershey in raising its margins, 590 bps to 470 bps, and barely beat Nestle&#8217;s 440 bps improvement. It also shows that Mondelez&#8217;s 2016 margins of 15.3% stand far below Hershey&#8217;s 24.4% and Nestle&#8217;s 19.5%.<\/p>\n<p>In its rebuttal, Trian states that a basic error skews the comparison in favor of Hershey and Nestle. P&amp;G, says Trian, is using EBIT for the earlier periods, and EBITDA for 2016 figures. Since EBITDA adds depreciation and amortization back to earnings, it gives a big boost to last year&#8217;s margins, and hugely inflates, and misstates, the improvement from 2013.<\/p>\n<p>To see who&#8217;s right, I ran the numbers. Let&#8217;s start with Nestle. P&amp;G states that it&#8217;s excluding coffee from its calculations, apparently because Mondelez recently sold its own coffee franchise. From Nestle&#8217;s 10Ks, I was unable to determine coffee&#8217;s precise contribution to sales and profits; however, even including coffee, the overall numbers demonstrate P&amp;G&#8217;s faulty math. In 2013, Nestle posted an EBIT margin of 15.27%. In 2016, P&amp;G claims that Nestle&#8217;s margins showed an improvement of over 400 bps, rising to 19.5%. But it appears that Nestle is using EBIT for 2013, and EBITDA for 2016. By my calculations, it&#8217;s only by adding back depreciation and amortization, raising EBIT by almost one-quarter, that Nestle&#8217;s record &#8220;improves&#8221; at all.<\/p>\n<p>Trian claims that if EBIT in 2013 is compared with EBIT in 2016, Nestle added only 100 bps to its margins. That&#8217;s what my calculations show as well.<\/p>\n<p>For Hershey, P&amp;G&#8217;s numbers are even more misleading. They show EBIT for 2013 at 18.5%; that&#8217;s actually the figure for 2012. The correct number for 2013 is 19.2% As with Nestle, P&amp;G the switches to EBIDA for 2016. So Hershey&#8217;s improvement is inflated twice, first by starting in the wrong year with a lower base, and second by ddding amortization and depreciation for 2016, while excluding them for 2013. Those factors combined boost Hershey&#8217;s gains by a factor of five, from the actual 115 basis points to a huge 590 basis points.<\/p>\n<p>Trian&#8217;s position that Mondelez raised EBIT a lot more than either Hershey or Nestle appears correct. Comparing EBIT in one year to EBITDA in another is like comparing grapes to avocados. As I&#8217;ve previously stated, P&amp;G&#8217;s weak defense of its own record is the best argument for putting Peltz on its board. These new, bogus numbers only strengthen the case for Trian.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 22, 2017","published":"2017-09-22 02:29:39","updated":"2017-09-22 02:29:39","minute":"2:29 PM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/procter-gamble-nelson-peltz-trian\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/procter-gamble-nelson-peltz-trian\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/procter-gamble-nelson-peltz-trian\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"P&G Needs to Work on Its Math","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/gettyimages-618078558.jpg?w=800&h=488&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_must_reads_2x","credit":"Patrick T.

(The ride-sharing giant went with Dara Khosrowshahi.) And recently she\u2019s been leading on a bigger stage. A lifelong Republican, Whitman switched her support to Hillary Clinton three months before last year\u2019s election\u2014she was the only <i>Fortune<\/i> Most Powerful Woman to publicly campaign for a nominee\u2014stoking speculation that the former gubernatorial candidate would reenter the political arena. \u201cFrankly, I think a leader of every organization now needs to stand up and be counted,\u201d Whitman says. \u201cHistory will judge.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Whitman is still most celebrated for her decade at eBay, which she grew from oddball dotcom startup to e-commerce powerhouse. But the reputation she earned there is the opposite of who she\u2019s become: a turnaround CEO, the grownup who could clean up HP\u2019s mess\u2014and why not Uber\u2019s too? The cynic\u2019s view is that she\u2019s a one-hit wonder, boxed in at a company whose glory days are long behind it. Now, confidants think the intensely competitive Whitman wants another chance to solidify her legacy. Says Neri, \u201cMeg does not like to lose, trust me; she does not like to lose.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-medium-width alignleft\" style=\"max-width:168px;\" ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/screen-shot-2017-09-21-at-5-38-04-pm.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2160818\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/hp-hpe-meg-whitman\/screen-shot-2017-09-21-at-5-38-04-pm\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/screen-shot-2017-09-21-at-5-38-04-pm.png?w=168&#038;h=777\" data-orig-size=\"168,777\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2017-09-21 at 5.38.04 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/screen-shot-2017-09-21-at-5-38-04-pm.png?w=168&#038;h=777?w=65\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/screen-shot-2017-09-21-at-5-38-04-pm.png?w=168&#038;h=777?w=168\" class=\"wp-image-2160818 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/screen-shot-2017-09-21-at-5-38-04-pm.png?w=168&#038;h=777\" alt=\"\" width=\"168\" height=\"777\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\"> Meg Whitman&#8217;s professional experience<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">A hard hat<b>: <\/b><\/span>That\u2019s what Whitman\u2019s new coworkers gave her when she became Hewlett-Packard\u2019s CEO. Covered in stickers bearing idioms such as \u201cCatch a falling knife,\u201d the construction gear sent a not-so-subtle message: In this job, <i>use extreme caution.<\/i><i> <\/i><\/p>\n<p>When she took over in September 2011, HP was enjoying its best year ever, with sales peaking at $127 billion. But it didn\u2019t feel that way. Her predecessor, L\u00e9o Apotheker, had lasted barely 11 months; he had succeeded Mark Hurd, who left <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/hp\/\" target=\"_blank\">Hewlett-Packard<\/a> after being accused of sexual harassment and expense account discrepancies. (Hurd, now co-CEO of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/oracle\/\" target=\"_blank\">Oracle<\/a>, has always denied wrongdoing.) And Apotheker\u2019s $11 billion deal to buy British software company Autonomy would soon go down as one of the worst acquisitions in corporate history, leaving HP with a hangover that included an $8.8 billion write-down.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Whitman, who joined HP\u2019s board in early 2011, turned down the CEO job the first time it was offered. The wounds from her most recent leading role were fresh: As the GOP nominee for California governor, the billionaire had spent 2\u00bd years campaigning and $110 million from her own pocket, only to lose decisively to Jerry Brown in 2010. (\u201cThis is really not good,\u201d Whitman\u2019s neurosurgeon husband remarked upon catching her watching daytime television after the election.) But after a stealth meeting in New Jersey on Sept. 11, 2011, where the board voted to oust Apotheker, Whitman and fellow director Marc Andreessen were on a plane back to San Francisco when the venture capitalist cornered her with a recruitment pitch. \u201cTwo hours in, something in her eyes changed,\u201d Andreessen recalls.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Drawn by what Andreessen calls noblesse oblige, Whitman recognized an opportunity to revive the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/10\/06\/goodbye-hp-meg-whitman\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">faltering legacy of the company that birthed SiliconValley<\/a>: Hewlett-Packard, founded in 1939 in a Palo Alto garage.She had neither tech expertise nor B2B sales experience, but she summoned a sense of patriotic duty: HP was important, she told employees\u2014to them, to the technology industry, and to America itself. \u201cIt had been a long time since the great days of HP,\u201d says Ray Lane, an HPE board member and former HP chairman. \u201cShe went in and got it to remember its groove.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Her first changes were cultural. Whitman doesn\u2019t hide her disdain for the way Hurd\u2014who kept all but his inner circle at arm\u2019s length\u2014ran things. On day two she peeled off the smoke-tinted window film that shielded the C-suite from view and tore down fencing around the executive parking lot. As someone who never had a corner office\u2014or any office\u2014at eBay, she moved everyone to cubicles and plunked down in one herself. Getting staff to open up was like pulling teeth, Whitman says: \u201cThe company was pretty shell-shocked, honestly.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">HP\u2019s problems, she found, were even greater than she had fathomed. Whitman recalls a vacation trekking in New Zealand where she was without cell phone service for almost a week. She exited the wilderness to a string of missed calls from her CFO, who broke the news that revenue and operating income would be billions of dollars lower than expected. In -November 2012 the company\u2019s stock sank below $12, the nadir of her tenure.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe10_c.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2158599\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/hp-hpe-meg-whitman\/meg-whitman-and-supporters-attend-election-night-gathering\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe10_c.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" data-orig-size=\"2880,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Kevork Djansezian&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D3S&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;UNIVERSAL CITY, CA - NOVEMBER 02:  California Republican gubernatorial candidate and former eBay CEO Meg Whitman greets supporters after conceding to governor elect to Jerry Brown during a campaign party on November 2, 2010 in Universal City, California.

Appointing a red team and a blue team to argue the pros and cons, Whitman initially resisted a split. Instead, she looked for efficiencies. In total, she\u2019s eliminated some 75,000 jobs between HP and HPE. Still, customer requests went unresolved in HP\u2019s \u201ctechnology supermarket,\u201d so she promulgated a new motto: \u201cRun to the fire.\u201d Some HP managers found Whitman\u2019s directives patronizing. She reeled in employees who worked remotely. A punctuality zealot, she\u2019d chide staff for starting meetings a couple of minutes late. Some managers were put off when she personally checked their travel schedules. Says one former exec, \u201cWe were all adults there.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Whitman had predicted 2014 would \u201cbe the year you\u2019ll see real recovery and expansion.\u201d But by the time it arrived, a strengthening dollar had sapped international sales, price wars had heated up, and revenue and profits had continued to contract. Amid the bad news, Whitman joined Team Breakup: In October 2014 she announced <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/10\/06\/hewlett-packard-split\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HP would split in half<\/a>. \u201cIt was so obvious to me that these companies were going to be better off alone and they could go faster,\u201d she says.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The old HP, for one, <\/span>might never have gone to Mars. A few months after becoming CEO, Whitman dropped in on HP\u2019s R&amp;D laboratory and asked, \u201cYou got anything we can sell?\u201d The engineers showed her a curiosity that had been seasoning in their skunkworks since 2003. A supercomputer built with an unprecedented 160 terabytes of memory\u2014equivalent to 20,000 laptops\u2014they called it simply \u201cThe Machine.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Today, The Machine, now part of HPE, is the largest R&amp;D project in the history of Hewlett-Packard; Whitman estimates the total cost at more than $500 million. Veteran lab rats consider it their biggest breakthrough since the laser-jet printer. Already its computing prowess is being used to process genetic research data 100 times faster; HPE engineers hope it will one day travel on Mars missions to empower far-flung astronauts to run experiments without contacting Earth. That said, the term \u201cmoonshot\u201d is largely eschewed at HPE. With fingernail profit margins compared to Google\u2019s and Apple\u2019s, the company can\u2019t afford to frivol. \u201cWe\u2019re super-excited about it, but we have to commercialize it,\u201d Whitman says of The Machine.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width alignnone\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe_graphics.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2158892\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/hp-hpe-meg-whitman\/hpe_graphics\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe_graphics.png?w=1024&#038;h=1506\" data-orig-size=\"1220,1794\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"hpe_graphics\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Charts show number of employees and revenues for HPE&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe_graphics.png?w=1024&#038;h=1506?w=204\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe_graphics.png?w=1024&#038;h=1506?w=696\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2158892\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe_graphics.png?w=1024&#038;h=1506\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1506\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe_graphics.png?w=1024&amp;h=1506 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe_graphics.png?w=102&amp;h=150 102w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe_graphics.png?w=204&amp;h=300 204w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe_graphics.png?w=768&amp;h=1129 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe_graphics.png?w=696&amp;h=1024 696w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe_graphics.png 1220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Nicolas Rapp<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Running a smaller company has freed up Whitman to pitch real-life products. She spends 70% of her time meeting with customers, she says. What she lacks in hardware knowledge, she makes up for with her Rolodex: \u201cShe hadn\u2019t sold CEOs servers before, but she knew all the CEOs,\u201d Andreessen says. Whitman cold-calls customers so often that some are initially standoffish, believing they\u2019re being punked. \u201cThe first time it happened, I thought, gosh, that customer is so unfriendly,\u201d she says. Three minutes after hanging up, the customer emailed her: \u201cI just got a call from someone who\u2019s impersonating you!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Still, there are lingering doubts that Whitman\u2019s pavement pounding will restore HPE to an upward trajectory. This year, HPE divested its enterprise services and software divisions, part of what Whitman calls her \u201cvery focused strategy.\u201d But even the CEO doesn\u2019t always sound convinced it will work. Driving to work after her swim, she tells <i>Fortune,<\/i> \u201cI think we need a couple more years to sort of prove out the revenue growth thesis.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">It\u2019s not just Whitman\u2019s legacy at stake, but also that of the company she leads. She has increased value for shareholders, but while each share of HP held since she took over has returned 120% (inclusive of the separation and spinoffs), that lags the S&amp;P 500\u2019s 149%. What\u2019s more, she has boosted share price by dismantling a business. \u201cIn tech, a rule of thumb is, if you\u2019re not growing, you\u2019re dying,\u201d says Steven Milunovich, a managing director at UBS and a longtime enterprise tech analyst. \u201cShe obviously wants to be on the right side of that, but it\u2019s going to be a struggle.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">The competitive landscape, meanwhile, remains brutal. While many businesses are <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/01\/hpe-meg-whitman-servers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">moving data to the cloud<\/a> (using providers such as <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/amazon-com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/microsoft\/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft<\/a>), HPE caters to companies that want on-premises storage. That market is slow-growing and fragmented, and HPE is neck and neck with Dell EMC and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/cisco-systems\/\" target=\"_blank\">Cisco<\/a>, limiting the prices it can charge. The struggle is testing Whitman\u2019s mettle, and as the company shrinks, some former colleagues now see her as merely a financial engineer, gifted at execution but lacking vision.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Whitman\u2019s advocates praise her for making the tough choices necessary to assure Hewlett-Packard\u2019s future. Still, even defenders see the best-case trajectory under Whitman as one of soft landings, not interplanetary ascents. \u201cThe question is, could you have gotten your mojo back, and could HP have been great again as a $100 billion company?\u201d asks Lane, the board member. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">For a leader <\/span><span class=\"s2\">familiar with the hard knocks of politics, Whitman has been unafraid to flip-flop. <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/10\/30\/bye-bye-hp\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deciding to split HP<\/a> was one reversal; another was her Democratic defection after Chris Christie, her GOP candidate of choice, bowed out. Her courtship at scandal-plagued Uber may have been another<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">In July she <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/28\/meg-whitman-uber-hpe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">publicly took herself out of the running for Kalanick\u2019s job<\/a>, tweeting, \u201cUber\u2019s CEO will not be Meg Whitman.\u201d As an investor in the startup, she had advised Kalanick and his deputies for years, and after his June resignation she had offered her counsel again. Some on the board saw in her his ideal replacement, despite, she claims, her lack of interest. \u201cI wasn\u2019t that attracted,\u201d she told me in mid-August. Though she can see why they\u2019d want her: \u201cI have marketplace experience, I have political experience, I have big complex experience, and I\u2019ve changed cultures. Right? So, there\u2019s sort of a natural, like, \u2018Wow, Meg would be great.\u2019\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe10_b.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2158597\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/hp-hpe-meg-whitman\/hpe10_b\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe10_b.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" data-orig-size=\"2880,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5.6&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Brinson+Banks&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;PENTAX 645Z&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman keeps a swim cap at her desk at the Hewlett Packard Corporate Headquarters in Palo Alto, California September 13, 2017. \\r\\rCredit: Brinson+Banks&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1505319205&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Brinson+Banks&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;55&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;1600&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.008&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Meg Whitman HPE swim cap\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman keeps a swim cap at her desk at the Hewlett Packard Corporate Headquarters in Palo Alto, California September 13, 2017. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Credit: Brinson+Banks&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe10_b.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe10_b.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=1024\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2158597\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe10_b.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\"Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman keeps a swim cap at her desk at the Hewlett Packard Corporate Headquarters in Palo Alto, California September 13, 2017.

The ride-sharing company\u2019s growth possibilities, Whitman said in a statement afterward, \u201cremind me of eBay in its early days,\u201d but \u201cit wasn\u2019t the right thing.\u201d She reasserted her commitment to HPE, but she didn\u2019t dispel the perception that some part of her would rather work for an Uber. Some expect she could leave HPE by the end of the year. Heidrick &amp; Struggles, the headhunting firm that conducted Uber\u2019s search, wouldn\u2019t comment on Whitman\u2019s prospects, citing its \u201cpolicy of not commenting on candidates or companies engaging in a search.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">So what\u2019s next for Whitman? \u201cShe\u2019s born to run large organizations,\u201d Andreessen says. \u201cI think she\u2019s happiest when she\u2019s doing that.\u201d Which raises the question of politics: There are few organizations larger than the United States, after all. <\/span>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Meg ended up the first female President,\u201d says Bob Kagle, a cofounder of venture capital firm Benchmark, who helped recruit Whitman to eBay. <span class=\"s2\">Indeed, Whitman says she saw elements of herself in Clinton\u2014members of \u201cthe same generation of women who were pioneering.\u201d After rebuking Donald Trump last year as a \u201cdishonest demagogue,\u201d Whitman refused a post-election invitation to join one of his now-disbanded business councils. She has since slammed Trump\u2019s actions on the Paris climate accord, white supremacist violence, and immigration. She deflects accusations of betrayal from Republicans. \u201cI haven\u2019t turned my back on the party,\u201d she says. \u201cI would say maybe the party has turned their back on me.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Whitman won\u2019t rule out being CEO of another company; she had ruled it out after eBay, she points out, and now look where we are. Ask her whether she\u2019d run for President, however, and a look like she ate a sour cherry comes over her face. A political appointment, maybe, but running for office? \u201cI\u2019m definitely not doing that.\u201d But given Whitman\u2019s history, you can never say never.<\/p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appears in the Oct. 1, 2017 issue of Fortune with the headline &#8220;Boxed In.&#8221; <\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 22, 2017","published":"2017-09-22 06:30:11","updated":"2017-09-22 06:30:11","minute":"6:30 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/hp-hpe-meg-whitman\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/hp-hpe-meg-whitman\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/hp-hpe-meg-whitman\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"HPE\u2019s Meg Whitman Won\u2019t Be Uber\u2019s CEO.

And there appears to be a rather sizable contingent of people that have decided to wait until the iPhone X is released in November instead of buying an iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus now.<\/p>\n<p>After all, Apple&#8217;s <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AAPL\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a data-type=\"stock-ticker:AAPL\" class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/apple\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AAPL<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/16\/apple-iphone-x-news\/\">iPhone X is a major upgrade over last year&#8217;s iPhone 7<\/a>, delivering a glass and stainless steel design, a screen that covers its face, and a new Face ID feature for scanning faces and verifying purchases. Apple has even called iPhone X the &#8220;future&#8221; of smartphones.<\/p>\n<p>All of that might have led some customers to the reasonable conclusion of waiting for iPhone X. But I think there are valid reasons to go with an iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus now instead of waiting for iPhone X. And here are three of the biggest reasons buying iPhone 8 today is a good idea:<\/p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getdatasheet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Get Data Sheet<\/a>, <\/em>Fortune<em>\u2019s technology newsletter<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>The Early Adopter Curse<\/h2>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s iPhone X is a brand-new device with features we&#8217;ve never seen in an iPhone before. We&#8217;ve also heard reports of some troubles in Apple&#8217;s manufacturing pipeline.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, those items could mean nothing. But they could also translate to the iPhone X&#8217;s screen not being as vibrant or colorful as Apple has promised. It could also mean that Apple&#8217;s Face ID technology will be a little sluggish.<\/p>\n<p>The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, on the other hand, are nearly identical to last year&#8217;s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. They&#8217;ve garnered some criticism for that, but at least you know they&#8217;ll work well out of the box.<\/p>\n<p>Being an early adopter of a brand-new technology can be fraught with risk, even if that product is made by Apple. Don&#8217;t forget that.<\/p>\n<h2>iPhone 8 Is No Slouch<\/h2>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s iPhone X might be the flashy update, but the company&#8217;s iPhone 8 line is nothing to scoff at.<\/p>\n<p>The iPhone 8 comes with the same processor as the iPhone X, the A11 Bionic. It also runs on the same iOS 11 software. Together, they&#8217;re delivering what recent benchmarks describe as the most powerful smartphone on the market.<\/p>\n<p>On the design side, the iPhone 8 might come with a traditional design with a physical home button, and the screen might be smaller than the 5.8-inch display in the iPhone X, but it&#8217;s still one of the most attractive smartphones out there. And with its new glass finish and wireless charging support, it feels like a premium device.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, iPhone X might not be as major an upgrade as you might think.<\/p>\n<h2>How Badly Do You Want a New iPhone?<\/h2>\n<p>If you really badly need (or want) a new iPhone now, the iPhone X might not be your best bet.<\/p>\n<p>Whenever you&#8217;d like, you can walk into an Apple Store or carrier outlet and walk out with an iPhone 8 without too much trouble.<\/p>\n<p>But just about every report we hear about the iPhone X is that it&#8217;ll be in short supply and with demand so high, actually getting it on launch day might be impossible. Worse yet, low manufacturing yields could mean iPhone X could be hard to come by for weeks, if not longer.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, all of those reports could be wrong. But if you&#8217;re not so keen on camping outside of an Apple store or getting in early on late-night pre-orders, going with an iPhone 8 makes a lot of sense.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 22,

Buildings shook, dozens collapsed, and dust clouds formed in the sky. The injured were rushed to the hospital, but many are missing, trapped under the collapsed buildings. More than 200 people have lost their lives. Rescuers have been searching through the rubble of buildings, homes, and schools since yesterday, while more than 3,400 soldiers were deployed to affected areas, according to the Mexican Secretariat of National Defense. Thousands of volunteers, including college students, went out into the Mexico City streets to join the rescue crews and help clear the destruction.<\/p>\n<p>Helpers provided food and water for families and handed out blankets. By nightfall, power shortages and blackouts led to more difficult rescue tasks. Soldiers and marines aided in the areas of the blacked-out streets. Public transportation shut down its operations after the quake blocked countless streets, and nearly 5 million people were still without power early Wednesday.<\/p>\n<p>Tuesday&#8217;s earthquake came more than a week after an <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/08\/mexico-8-1-earthquake-tsunami\/\">8.1 magnitude earthquake<\/a> shook the southern coast of the country, killing more than 90 people.

Here's How","content":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/23\/sarahah-anonymous-hit-app\/\">Sarahah<\/a> is the latest anonymous messaging app to blow up on the App Store&#8217;s download charts. And a lot of users are interested in how they can link it to their Snapchat account.<\/p>\n<p>While you can&#8217;t directly link Sarahah to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/19\/snapchat-nbc-millennials\/\">Snapchat,<\/a> you can easily share posts between the two apps, <a href=\"http:\/\/metro.co.uk\/2017\/07\/19\/what-is-the-sarahah-app-and-how-can-you-link-it-to-your-snapchat-6791768\/\">Metro reported<\/a>. That&#8217;s thanks in part to a new linking feature Snapchat added on July 5.<\/p>\n<p>On the right-hand side of a new snap, where you have the option to add things like text and emojis, there is now a paper clip icon that takes users to a clipboard. Here, they can paste a link to attach to a new post. That post can then be sent as a direct message or added to their Snapchat story. Once it&#8217;s live, viewers will get the option to &#8220;Swipe Up&#8221; to access it.<\/p>\n<p>So Snapchat users with a Sarahah account can simply include the link to their profile, which is usually their username followed by .sarahah.com. And don&#8217;t worry: you don&#8217;t need a Sarahah profile of your own in order to see another person&#8217;s page.<\/p>\n<p>Sarahah allows people to send messages to another Sarahah account <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/09\/16\/anonymous-messaging-app-whisper-raising-new-funds\/\">completely anonymously<\/a>. The app has seen success in the Middle East. Its name comes from the Arabic word for &#8220;candor&#8221; or &#8220;openness.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>You might be wondering about the potential to link Sarahah on Instagram or <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/06\/instagram-stories-video-photos\/\">Instagram stories<\/a>. For now, the option to attach links to posts is only available for verified users.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 26, 2017","published":"2017-07-26 04:48:46","updated":"2017-07-26 04:48:46","minute":"4:48 PM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/26\/sarahah-snapchat-link\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/26\/sarahah-snapchat-link\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/26\/sarahah-snapchat-link\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":false,"short_title":"","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"16\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5527044396001-16\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5527044396001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2tZD3zV\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dsaharaapp%2Csaharah%2Csarahahanonymous%2Csarahahapp%2Csarahahdownload%2Csarahahmeaning%2Csarahahmessages%2Ctechdebate%2Cwhatissarahah%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dtechdebate&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"excerpt":"<p>Sarahah is the new &#8220;it&#8221; anonymous messaging app.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"1988501","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/lisa-marie-segarra\/","name":"Lisa Marie Segarra","twitter":"","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":false,"thumbnail_alt":false,"thumbnail_src":false,"bio":"Lisa Marie Segarra is a news writer at <em>Fortune<\/em>.","title":"","company":"","is_contributor":"not-contributor"}],"sections":[{"term_id":447824897,"name":"Tech","slug":"tech","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46728,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News, analysis, and insight into technology and business, including Silicon Valley giants like Apple, Google, Facebook, and our annual Brainstorm Tech conference.","parent":0,"count":44038,"filter":"raw"}],"section":{"name":"Tech","slug":"tech","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/tech\/","newsletter_info":"Data Sheet"},"tags":[{"term_id":447811327,"name":"OneTime","slug":"onetime","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":178270,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":6093,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":447830312,"name":"Sarahah","slug":"sarahah","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":195491,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":6,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":80687524,"name":"Snapchat","slug":"snapchat","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46903,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":496,"filter":"raw"}],"has_commentary_tag":false,"primary_tag":{"name":"Sarahah","slug":"sarahah","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/tag\/sarahah\/"},"f500_tag":false,"paid":false,"paid_excerpt":"Sarahah is the new &#8220;it&#8221; anonymous messaging app.","seo":{"seo_title":"Sarahah Snapchat: How to Link the Two Apps","seo_description":"Sarahah is the latest messaging app to to top the App Store charts.

The earthquake, and subsequent tsunami waves (which were up to 130 feet high), caused $220 billion in damage to Japan. The waves hit the Fukushima Daiichi plant so hard that the nuclear facility began to melt down.

As of this writing, there have not been any reports of damage or tsunami warnings, but the earthquake hit at 2:37 a.m. local time, and the story is still developing.<\/p>\n<p>After the 2011 event caused massive damage at the <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3780099\/revisiting-japans-ground-zero\/\">Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant,<\/a> Japan is understandably on edge over undersea earthquakes. During the earthquake\u2014which was the fourth-largest in world since measurements began in 1900\u2014 and the subsequent tsunami, nearly 20,000 people died or went missing.<\/p>\n<p>The tsunami waves, not the earthquake, were what caused the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear facility to melt down. Amidst the fallout, the nearby town was ordered to evacuate. More than 5,000 aftershocks hit over the next year, causing $220 billion in damage to to the country.<\/p>\n<p>The images of that disaster were heart-crushing, and many have been indelibly burned into the world&#8217;s collective memory. The photo gallery above is a reminder of both the might of Mother Nature and the potential danger of nuclear power, as well as a warning for what could happen the next time a big earthquake hits.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 20, 2017","published":"2017-09-20 06:04:26","updated":"2017-09-20 06:04:26","minute":"6:04 PM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/20\/japan-earthquake-tsunami-fukushima-pictures\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/20\/japan-earthquake-tsunami-fukushima-pictures\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/20\/japan-earthquake-tsunami-fukushima-pictures\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":false,"short_title":"Japan Earthquake: Pictures of Fukushima's Last Tsunami","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/rtr2l7yn.jpg?w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Kyodo\/Reuters","caption":"Toya Chiba, a reporter for local newspaper Iwate Tokai Shimbun, is swept by the tsunami as he was gathering news with his video camera, at Kamaishi port, Iwate prefecture, which was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.

Outtakes","content":"<p>Leaked footage of a visibly frustrated Lawrence O&#8217;Donnell surfaced on Wednesday, showing the MSNBC host getting increasingly upset about a series of sound problems during a recent broadcast of his show, <em>The Last Word with Lawrence O&#8217;Donnell<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mediaite.com\/tv\/exclusive-watch-msnbcs-lawrence-odonnells-unhinged-outtakes-for-eight-crazy-minutes\/\">video clip<\/a> published by the website Mediaite, O&#8217;Donnell is seen yelling at members of his production staff as he grows more and more frustrated by unwelcome voices coming through his earpiece. Soon a hammering sound proves distracting as the veteran cable news host tries to introduce a series of clips, including one about President Donald Trump&#8217;s trip to Houston last month in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. The roughly eight-minute clip appears to have been leaked to Mediaite by someone with access to MSNBC&#8217;s uncut footage.<\/p>\n<p>Early on in the video, O&#8217;Donnell begins to get upset as he complains about <span class=\"s1\">a mysterious woman\u2019s voice talking in his earpiece about a &#8220;Labor Day rundown.&#8221; Throughout the clip, the MSNBC host complains about hearing excess chatter through his earpiece, and he demands at one point that the production staff empty out of the show&#8217;s control room to determine the root of the problem. &#8220;You have insanity in my earpiece,&#8221; the upset anchor grumbles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getdatasheet\/\">Get Data Sheet<\/a>, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Later in the video, O&#8217;Donnell complains about hearing a hammering sound, but he can&#8217;t identify where the sound is originating. &#8220;<span class=\"s1\">Who has a hammer?\u201d he asks. &#8220;Stop the hammering!&#8221; O&#8217;Donnell begins yelling and uttering a string of expletives in between completing takes for his show. &#8220;<\/span><span class=\"s1\">It fucking sucks to be out here with this out-of-control shit,&#8221; he says at one moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>At one point, O&#8217;Donnell even <span class=\"s1\">suggests that someone on the staff contact MSNBC president Phil Griffin to take care of the sound issues. &#8220;<\/span><span class=\"s1\">I don\u2019t care who the fuck you have to call, stop the hammering!&#8221; O&#8217;Donnell pleads. After <\/span><span class=\"s1\">being informed that the alleged hammering sound is likely coming from a different floor of the building, O&#8217;Donnell demands that someone go to the floor above his studio and put a stop to the racket.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>An MSNBC spokesperson declined to comment on the leaked footage after <em>Fortune<\/em> reached out to the network.

The latest watch includes standalone cellular data connectivity for the first time, meaning it can be used to make phone calls without an iPhone nearby.<\/p>\n<p>Chayce O&#8217;Neal, 27, said he had come to buy the new watch and wasn&#8217;t discouraged by reviews that mentioned connectivity problems. But he was skipping the iPhone 8 and holding out for the iPhone X.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I like being on top of the cutting edge of technology,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Indifferent reviews of the iPhone 8, which comes 10 years after<span class=\"highlight\"> Apple <\/span>released the first version of the revolutionary phone, drove down shares of the company to near two-month lows of $152.75 on Thursday, as investors worried <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/19\/apple-iphone-8-preorders-disappoint\/\">pre-orders for the device had come in well below previous launches<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The iPhone 8 will only cater to those who want a new version but do not want to pay a hefty $999 for the iPhone X, said iTWire.com&#8217;s technology editor Alex Zaharov-Reutt, who did not line up for the launch.<\/p>\n<p>That was the case for Damien Roberts, a customer in line at<span class=\"highlight\"> Apple<\/span>&#8216;s San Francisco store. Roberts owns a battered iPhone 6s and wanted an <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/18\/sprint-free-iphone-8\/\">upgrade to the iPhone 8 Plus<\/a> for phone calls, messages and playing his favorite video game &#8220;Clash of Clans.&#8221; He said he didn&#8217;t need the extra features of the $999 iPhone X.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lot of money to shell out for a phone,&#8221; said Roberts, a Briton who was purchasing the phone while on vacation.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking to CNBC,<span class=\"highlight\"> Apple <\/span>Chief Executive Tim Cook said the<span class=\"highlight\"> Apple <\/span>Watch with cellular data service is &#8220;sold out in so many places around the world&#8221; and iPhone 8 models were also sold out. He did not specify the locations he was referring to.<\/p>\n<p>The iPhone X is a glass and stainless steel device with an edge-to-edge display that Cook has called &#8220;the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;ll be more lively with more people with the iPhone X,&#8221; said Ray Yokoyama, after buying an iPhone 8 in

The decision gives the Trump Administration the power to issue steep tariffs on Chinese companies\u2014where the majority are made\u2014cutting off the flow of cheap panels to installers in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>The upshot? Solar panel costs could rise for homeowners and businesses, forcing installation companies to potentially cut jobs, industry groups and analysts argue.<\/p>\n<p>In April, manufacturer <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/08\/15\/us-solar-energy-tariffs-panels\/\">Suniva petitioned the ITC<\/a>\u2014nine days after the company sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection\u2014arguing that an influx of cheap panels made it impossible for them to compete. SolarWorld supported its petition. Suniva has requested that solar cells brought into the United States have a 40-cent tariff. The company wants solar panels to have a minimum price of 78 cents a watt, which is two-thirds more expensive than the cheapest panels on the market.<\/p>\n<p>Suniva, which makes panels in Georgia and Michigan, is owned by Hong Kong-based Shunfeng International Clean Energy since 2015. SolarWorld is a German manufacturer that has a subsidiary based in Oregon.<\/p>\n<p>Tesla, which owns SolarCity, said its project will continue regardless of the final outcome.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTesla is currently building the largest solar cell and module plant in the U.S., and we are committed to expanding our domestic manufacturing with or without any tariff or price guarantees, a Tesla spokewoman said.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The issue has split the solar industry. On one side are a few solar manufacturers like Suniva and SolarWorld that say low-cost imports have made it impossible to be profitable. On the other side is the U.S. solar installation industry, which has benefited from low-cost panels that have led to explosive growth in rooftop systems on homes and commercial buildings as well as massive solar farms.<\/p>\n<p>This boom in installations and solar farm construction has helped create thousands of jobs. U.S. solar industry employed 260,077 workers last year, a nearly 25% increase in the number of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/02\/07\/us-solar-jobs-2016\/\">solar jobs<\/a> between 2015 and 2016\u2014a jump largely driven by a massive increase in solar panel installations, according to a report released in February by the non-profit solar advocacy group <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thesolarfoundation.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Solar Foundation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But now, analysts and the Solar Energy Industries Association say tariffs threaten to gut the industry.<\/p>\n<p>Suniva&#8217;s remedy proposal will double the price of solar, destroy two-thirds of demand, erode billions of dollars in investment and and unnecessarily force 88,000 Americans to lose their jobs in 2018, SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said in a statement citing analysts&#8217; forecasts.<\/p>\n<p>This could even impact U.S. taxpayers who help pay for tax credits used to encourage Americans to use more clean energy. This could mean U.S. taxpayers will pay as much as $1.23 billion more, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/about.bnef.com\/blog\/imposing-solar-tariffs-may-cost-u-s-taxpayers-1-23-billion\/\">Bloomberg

But we don\u2019t want to give up that growth. So we have been moving our product line to create natural, organic, and GMO-free products.<\/p>\n<p>Could we do more? Yes, but I worry about the availability of the raw materials. Being a large company, if we say something is organic, it better be organic. The labeling has very high standards. If anything, it\u2019s a supply-chain challenge.<\/p>\n<p><b>Research clearly shows people are wary of aspartame as a sweetener. But when you replaced it with sucralose in Diet Pepsi, consumers didn\u2019t bite. What happened? <\/b><\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a slight taste difference. It\u2019s not a degradation. It\u2019s slightly different. So what\u2019s the problem? This was my biggest puzzle, to be honest.<\/p>\n<p>What consumers think of as healthy is not always science-based. It\u2019s perception, what your friends told you, what the newest story is on the blogs or social media. Some of it might not be based on facts. If you look at potato chips in Whole Foods, they\u2019re not any healthier than Lay\u2019s. In fact I would say Lay\u2019s is even higher quality than what they sell. But just because it comes in a brown bag, people pay extra, thinking it is maybe natural, organic, or handmade.

I\u2019ll give you an example: hot beverages. It\u2019s been coffee and tea forever. It hasn\u2019t been disrupted yet. But you go to many local cultures, they drink a lot of other hot beverages. I have to light a creative spark here to get people to think differently. Don\u2019t start with coffee or tea.

But you also sat on President Trump\u2019s business advisory \u00adcouncil\u2014and were criticized for not stepping down from the group before it was disbanded in the wake of his comments about the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. How do you think about these political issues?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Until the election happens, you can support any candidate you want. There was a candidate that represented the values that I liked, but the day after the election, whoever is elected President is my President. And I congratulated him on that. And even today, he is our President.<\/p>\n<p>It was a well-thought-through idea to get these councils together to help the President debate and discuss certain issues. The political cycle operates in short cycles. The issues and resolutions are long cycles. This is where business can straddle the two.<\/p>\n<p>I think in this case, perhaps some of the comments that had been made post-Charlottesville did create some consternation. If individual CEOs take action, it\u2019s not good for anybody\u2014then each of us becomes a media story. It\u2019s not a decision any of us took lightly, but circumstances demanded that we step down as a group.<\/p>\n<p><b>What went wrong with the Kendall Jenner protest ad, which received a lot of criticism? <\/b><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve thought about it a lot because I looked at the ad again and again and again trying to figure out what went wrong\u2014because it was a peace march not a protest march. It was people in happiness coming together. I realized the scene that caused the most consternation was the final one, when Kendall Jenner gave a Pepsi to the policeman, and it linked back to Black Lives Matter.<\/p>\n<p>This has pained me a lot because this company is known for diversity, and the fact that everybody who produced the commercial and approved the commercial did not link it to Black Lives Matter made me scratch my head. I had not seen that scene. And I take everything personally. The minute I saw people upset, I pulled it. And you know what, it\u2019s not worth it. There were people on both sides, but at the end of the day, our goal is not to offend anybody.<\/p>\n<p><b>What advice would you give women entering the workforce today?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Everybody has to enter the workforce knowing it\u2019s a long journey. For women, know your journey is going to be tougher because you have so many other priorities to worry about. Today people would argue that men have the same priorities. Yes, but women were born with an extra gene that makes us worry about those things just a little bit more. I don\u2019t know why\u2014societal or genetic\u2014but we worry about the family, the husband, evening\u2019s dinner, yesterday morning\u2019s breakfast, aging parents.<\/p>\n<p>Because we have so many issues to worry about we have to compartmentalize even better. We have to develop more skills to write lists and learn how to prioritize. If you don\u2019t know how to do it, go to a course to learn how to do it. I make a list every day of 50, 60 items, and I tick off what I\u2019ve done\u2014tiny things. If I\u2019m carrying two to three items over to the next day, it feels great. People say multitasking isn\u2019t very good.

And so far, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/18\/best-features-when-ios-11-releases\/\">I can tell you that your mileage may vary<\/a>.

But if you have an iPad, put everything down and download iOS 11 right now.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s my look at some of the good and not-so-good features in Apple&#8217;s iOS 11:<\/p>\n<h2>Good: No Learning Curve<\/h2>\n<p>One of the first things you&#8217;ll notice after downloading iOS 11 is that not much has changed. If you&#8217;re comfortable using iOS 10 and you know your way around the operating system&#8217;s gestures, you should feel at home with iOS 11.<\/p>\n<p>The operating system is extremely stable and I&#8217;ve experienced no problems with iOS 11 or third-party apps crashing.<\/p>\n<h2>Bad: No Learning Curve<\/h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s another side to that learning curve\u2014or lack thereof.<\/p>\n<p>Apple has largely played it safe with iOS 11, especially on the iPhone. Apple&#8217;s new operating system delivers only minor upgrades to its built-in apps like Mail and Messages, and the design has been tweaked ever so slightly.<\/p>\n<p>Granted, iPad owners are enjoying some big improvements (more on that in a bit), but it&#8217;d be nice to see Apple take some more chances with its iOS design concepts and blow us away with something new.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getdatasheet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Get Data Sheet<\/a>, <\/em>Fortune<em>\u2019s technology newsletter<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Good: Control Center Matters<\/h2>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t often find much value in Control Center in iOS 10. I felt it was too anemic on the feature side and its design was rather boring.<\/p>\n<p>Control Center in iOS 11, however, is far more useful. For one, you can customize Control Center to put there the shortcuts to apps and features you use most often. It&#8217;s really handy. It&#8217;s also much easier to control Apple Music, and getting the option to decide whether to turn off just your cellular connection, just your Wi-Fi, or everything in a traditional Airplane mode setting is a small but welcome addition.<\/p>\n<p>Already, I&#8217;m using Control Center far more than I had in the past.<\/p>\n<h2>Bad: Some Features Aren&#8217;t Yet Ready<\/h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are some features that Apple has been touting that you won&#8217;t see until later this year. Chief among them is peer-to-peer payments, a new option built inside Apple Pay that will let you quickly and easily send money to your friends and family. It&#8217;s not a deal-breaker, but having access to all features at launch would&#8217;ve been nice.<\/p>\n<h2>Good: iPad Lovers, Rejoice<\/h2>\n<p>The iPad owner really wins here with iOS 11.<\/p>\n<p>Apple has dramatically improved the iPad experience with iOS 11 by expanding the size of the Dock to get quick access to more apps. Apple&#8217;s iPad Pro owners will be able to do more out of the box, including the ability to digitally scan and sign files with Apple Pencil. And speaking of Apple Pencil, it really does work better in iOS 11.<\/p>\n<p>But the most important additions to iOS 11 on the iPad come in the form of multitasking features, like the ability to quickly switch between apps or use two programs at once. I&#8217;m a much more productive\u2014and happier\u2014iPad owner with iOS 11&#8217;s support.<\/p>\n<h2>Good: An Outstanding Camera App<\/h2>\n<p>When I opened the iOS 11 Camera app, I was surprised by how much of an improvement it is. The app&#8217;s filters are outstanding and the revamped Portrait option is something you need to try.<\/p>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s Camera app was a little behind on the feature front, but in iOS 11, the company has caught up. And I think you&#8217;ll really like what you&#8217;ll find.<\/p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts<\/h2>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s iOS 11 isn&#8217;t perfect, but it&#8217;s an outstanding operating system. Apple&#8217;s software is robust, reliable, and although there aren&#8217;t many on the iPhone side, the improvements Apple has made are the right ones that ultimately make for a better mobile experience.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re on the fence about <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/19\/apple-ios-11-download-guide\/\">whether to download iOS 11<\/a>, don&#8217;t be. It&#8217;s good. It&#8217;s really, really good.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 20, 2017","published":"2017-09-20 09:38:37","updated":"2017-09-20 09:38:37","minute":"9:38 AM

It Will Only Make Recovery Harder","content":"<p>With six dead, millions of residents facing months without electricity, and far-flung relatives desperately trying to contact their loved ones, Puerto Rico is only just beginning to grapple with the fallout from Hurricane Maria, the strongest storm the island has faced in nearly a century. Looming over those recovery efforts is a vital question: Who will foot the bill for the estimated $10 billion in damages?<\/p>\n<p>The answer would be complicated enough for a financially healthy Puerto Rico. But the island&#8217;s economy was in shambles well before Hurricane Maria ever formed. Puerto Rico declared a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/05\/03\/business\/dealbook\/puerto-rico-debt.html?mcubz=3\">form of bankruptcy<\/a> in May, facing a crushing multi-billion dollar debt load following years of financial mismanagement. For the last decade, the government hasn&#8217;t had the funds to repay its creditors or improve its aging infrastructure, let alone deal with the ramifications of a major hurricane.<\/p>\n<p>Officials are taking some steps to address the problem. The Commonwealth has been allowed by a federally organized task force overseeing its economy to reassign $1 billion from its current budget to emergency response and repair, according to its largest daily newspaper, <a href=\"https:\/\/protect-us.mimecast.com\/s\/LL0LBJiRdae4uK?domain=elnuevodia.com\">El Nuevo Dia<\/a>. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has approved additional federal disaster assistance.<\/p>\n<p>But experts say that may not be enough.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">n general, the disaster relief system is structured so people are meant to rely on their private insurance,<\/span>&#8221; says Professor James Kendra, director of the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware. Through FEMA, for example, individuals can only receive a maximum of $33,300\u2014hardly enough to rebuild a house, especially in Puerto Rico where just about 50% of houses in the territory are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/hurricane-maria-exposes-a-common-problem-for-puerto-rico-homeowners-no-insurance-1505940660\">covered by insurance<\/a>. How and to what degree Puerto Rico will fund repairs for essential public facilities, such as the bankrupt power authority, also remains unclear.<\/p>\n<p>Further complicating matters is that Puerto Rico&#8217;s economic history will limit its fundraising options. With $74 billion in debt and $49 billion in unfunded public pensions, the island has no access to capital markets. Even if it did, willing investors would be hard to find \u2014 Puerto Rico&#8217;s current bondholders are already nervous that Hurricane Maria will make it tougher for them to collect on their repayments, as the expected post-Maria tourism drought will mean in lost tax revenue.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Puerto Rico has exhausted its financial resources,&#8221; says Hernando Montero Salazar, director of Credit Analyisis at Stoever Glass &amp; Co. &#8220;That will leave them strictly with the options of the federal government to provide aid and restore infrastructure. That&#8217;s the only way Puerto Rico will be able to put themselves together.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Yet Puerto Rico may find it difficult to appeal to Congress, where, as a U.S. territory, it has no voting power. Additionally, lawmakers there have long chastised Puerto Rico for the mismanagement that led to its bankruptcy \u2014 particularly the fiscal conservatives who currently control the legislative branch. And even though its finances are now largely in the hands of the federal task force, the island&#8217;s track record could make it harder to officials to ask for more money. &#8220;With a Republican majority, they could attack [too large a package] as part of a bailout,&#8221; says Amilcar Barreto, an associate professor at Northeastern University.<\/p>\n<p>Even if Puerto Rico gets the money it needs to rebuild over the next few months, its long-term prospects remain grim. Unlike Houston, which had a flourishing economy when Hurricane Harvey hit, Puerto Rico has been struggling for years. The Commonwealth&#8217;s woes can be traced back to 2006, when a tax break for U.S. companies expired. An exodus of jobs soon followed, with the unemployment rate reaching over 12% earlier this year, more than double the overall U.S. figure. As the jobs left, people began to follow. The island&#8217;s population has shrunk to about 3.5 million from 3.8 million in 2000.<\/p>\n<p>Hurricane Maria could accelerate that trend, says Amilcar Barreto, an associate professor at Northeastern University. With the power authority predicting months of outages, Puerto Ricans may continue to flee the island, making it even harder for it to regain economic steam. &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">For many businesses, dealing with a fiscal crisis was bad enough,<\/span>&#8221; says Barreto. &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">I question whether or not good will be good enough.<\/span>&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>If there&#8217;s any silver lining, it&#8217;s that seeing images of the devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria could push lawmakers in Washington to open the coffers. That could help rebuild critical infrastructure, get the power back on, and start the long slog towards recovery. &#8220;There will an economic black hole for a good part of the year,&#8221; predicts John Mousseau, the director of fixed income at money management firm Cumberland Advisors. &#8220;[But] if you get this rebuilding underway, you start seeing Puerto Rico turning the other way.&#8221;<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 22, 2017","published":"2017-09-22 06:15:09","updated":"2017-09-22 06:15:09","minute":"6:15 PM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-help-recovery\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-help-recovery\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-help-recovery\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/gettyimages-850005718.jpg?w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Hector Retamal \u2014 AFP\/Getty Images","caption":"Trees are toppled in a parking lot at Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on September 20, 2017, during the passage of the Hurricane Maria.\nMaria made landfall on Puerto Rico on Wednesday, pummeling the US territory after already killing at least two people on its passage through the Caribbean.

In that time, I&#8217;ve discovered a bunch of hidden functions and neat tools that aren&#8217;t so apparent when you&#8217;re using some of the apps built into Apple&#8217;s <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AAPL\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a data-type=\"stock-ticker:AAPL\" class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/apple\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AAPL<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch operating system. And in my experience, those features have proven exceedingly useful in improving my productivity.<\/p>\n<p>So, if you have an iPhone or iPad running iOS 11 and you <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/18\/best-features-when-ios-11-releases\/\">want to check out some new ways to get more out of the operating system<\/a>, read on for my five favorite hidden iOS 11 features:<\/p>\n<h2>Customize Control Center<\/h2>\n<p>Arguably the coolest addition to iOS 11 is the ability to actually make the operating system&#8217;s Control Center app really, really useful.<\/p>\n<p>From the Settings pane, you can choose &#8220;Control Center&#8221; and decide whether you want to add or remove controls. Don&#8217;t like the Timer control but would love to add an Alarm control? Go for it. Want to quickly access your Apple TV Remote? Just send it over to Control Center.<\/p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;re done customizing, open Control Center by swiping up from your screen and you&#8217;ll see your customizations.<\/p>\n<h2>Share Long Wi-Fi Passwords<\/h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s nothing worse than trying to remember passwords. So, Apple has added a feature that allows you to automatically share your Wi-Fi password with the tap of one button. Better yet, you don&#8217;t need to share the password itself, adding a little security to the scenario.<\/p>\n<p>When someone running an iPhone or iPad with iOS 11 tries to connect to a network you&#8217;re already on, you&#8217;ll receive a notification, asking if you want to share your password with the person. If you choose to do so, the connection is sent to the other person and they&#8217;ll connect to the network.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getdatasheet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Get Data Sheet<\/a>, <\/em>Fortune<em>\u2019s technology newsletter<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>The One-Type Keyboard<\/h2>\n<p>The iOS 11 keyboard defaults to full-screen, but if you want to type with one hand, just hold your thumb down on the emoji icon in your keyboard. A box will pop up, allowing you to decide whether to keep the keyboard full screen or move it to the left or right. If you choose to move it, typing with one thumb is much, much easier.<\/p>\n<h2>Indoor Mapping<\/h2>\n<p>When you load up Apple Maps inside popular points of interest, like an airport, you&#8217;ll have the option to see an indoor map of your location. You can then use it navigate around, say, an airport terminal to find bathrooms, food, and other important places.<\/p>\n<h2>Text Siri<\/h2>\n<p>In addition to chatting with Apple&#8217;s virtual personal assistant Siri, you can also text your queries. To do so, you&#8217;ll need to go into the Settings pane and choose Accessibility. From there, pick Siri, and you&#8217;ll see the option to &#8220;Type to Siri.&#8221; When you turn that on, you&#8217;ll now be given the option to speak to Apple&#8217;s assistant or type your question. It&#8217;s a handy way to get answers when you&#8217;re in a loud environment and the assistant can&#8217;t hear you well.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 21, 2017","published":"2017-09-21

Several countries the U.S. is squaring off with these days have been neglecting to pay their fines.<\/p>\n<p>Russia reportedly owes over $104,000, Iran has run up $185,000 in fees and Syria has nearly $363,000 in unpaid tickets.

The filing revealed Mezger would lose 25% of his annual bonus this year. Moreover, the board also warned that if Mezger were involved in a similar incident, he would be dismissed.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear how much Mezger is expected to earn this year. But in 2016, that &#8220;bonus,&#8221; termed the non-equity incentive plan compensation, totaled nearly $3.8 million. 25% percent of that would be $950,000.<\/p>\n<p>Exactly how much money Mezger stands to lose following his rant against Griffin will depend on the company&#8217;s performance through the end of the year. Last year, had Mezger met his baseline performance as decided by the board, he would have been eligible for $750,000. Had he hit company targets, he would have been eligible for $1.5 million. At most, Mezger could have earned $6 million from the non-equity incentive plan award.<\/p>\n<p>In total, including stock, options, and his cash salary, Mezger earned $9 million in 2016.<\/p>\n<p>The filing comes after Griffin reportedly filed a noise complaint against Mezger, after which he confronted the comedian and called her a variety of sexist and homophobic terms, including a &#8220;f&#8211;king bald d-ke&#8221; and &#8220;f&#8211;king c&#8211;t.&#8221; The exchange was caught on security camera, the Huffington Post <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/20\/kathy-griffin-ceo-tirade\/\">reports<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The exchange cost Mezger a pretty penny even before board&#8217;s decision. He owns $12.1 million in KB Home stock, according to a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Following Mezger&#8217;s tirade, shares of KB Home have slid about 3%\u2014shaving off about $400,000 from his net worth.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 22, 2017","published":"2017-09-22

Puerto Rico","content":"<p>Hurricane Maria thrashed parts of the Dominican Republic with heavy rain and high winds as it passed near its east and north coasts on Thursday after <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/20\/hurricane-maria-puerto-rico-damages\/\">making a direct hit on Puerto Rico<\/a> that caused severe flooding and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/20\/hurricane-maria-power-puerto-rico\/\">cut power to the entire island<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Maria has killed at least 10 people as it raged through the Caribbean, the second major hurricane to do so this month, and the U.S. National Hurricane Canter (NHC) said it was headed toward the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas, bringing dangerous storm surges and torrential rain.<\/p>\n<p>It ripped roofs off almost all structures on the island country of Dominica, where seven people were confirmed dead. The toll is expected to climb when searches resume at daybreak.<\/p>\n<p>Maria was ranked a Category 4 storm, near the top end of the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained winds of up to 155 miles per hour (250 km per hour), when it hit Puerto Rico on Wednesday as the strongest storm to hit the U.S. territory in nearly 90 years.<\/p>\n<p>It ripped apart homes, snapped power lines and turned roadways into torrents laden with debris as it cut a diagonal swath across the island.<\/p>\n<p>The entire island of 3.4 million people was under a flash flood warning early on Thursday as the storm was forecast to dump 20 to 30 inches (50 to 76 cm) of rain on much of Puerto Rico through Friday, according to the NHC.<\/p>\n<p>The island&#8217;s governor, Ricardo Rossello, said the only fatality immediately reported was a man struck by a piece of lumber hurled by high winds.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/20\/hurricane-maria-puerto-rico-hospitals\/\">It&#8217;s nothing short of a major disaster<\/a>,&#8221; Rossello said in a CNN interview, adding it may take months for the island&#8217;s electricity to be completely restored. Earlier he imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew for the island.<\/p>\n<p>The streets of Puerto Rico&#8217;s historic Old Town in the capital, San Juan, were strewn with broken balconies, air conditioning units, shattered lamp posts, fallen power lines and dead birds. Few trees escaped unscathed.<\/p>\n<p>The island&#8217;s recovery could be complicated by its financial woes as it faces the largest municipal debt crisis in U.S. history. Both its government and the public utility have filed for bankruptcy protection amid disputes with creditors.<\/p>\n<p>Maria weakened as it went over land in Puerto Rico and picked up strength early on Thursday as it passed over warm Caribbean waters.<\/p>\n<p>It was a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph (185 kph) about 70 miles (110 kms) north of Punta Cana, on the east coast of the Dominican Republic, at 5 a.m. EDT (0900 GMT), the NHC said.<\/p>\n<p>Punta Cana, a popular tourist area, was hit with wind gusts of 58 mph (93 kph) and Maria was forecast to bring storm surges, when hurricanes push ocean water dangerously over normal levels, of up to 6 feet (1.83 m) in the Dominican Republic, it said.<\/p>\n<p>Maria was expected to pick up strength as it churns toward the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas. Storm surges on the islands could be as high as 12 feet (3.66 m), it said.<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8216;In a Daze&#8217;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Maria would then move north in the Atlantic Ocean over the weekend and there was no indication as to whether it would hit the continental United States.<\/p>\n<p>It was classified a Category 5 storm when it struck Dominica on Monday night with devastating force.<\/p>\n<p>Based on an aerial survey, about 95% of roofs in Dominica, one of the poorest countries in the Caribbean with a population of about 73,000, were damaged or destroyed by Maria, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. It added damage to the island could be in the billions of dollars.<\/p>\n<p>Hartley Henry, principal adviser to Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit, said on Wednesday: &#8220;The country is in a daze.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Passing early Wednesday just west of St. Croix, home to about 55,000 people, Maria damaged an estimated 65% to 70% of the island&#8217;s buildings, said Holland Redfield, who served six terms in the U.S. Virgin Islands senate.<\/p>\n<p>President Donald Trump declared a major disaster in the U.S. Virgin Islands and ordered federal aid to supplement recovery efforts, the White House said.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. and British Virgin Islands were also hit this month by Hurricane Irma, which ranked as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms on record. It left a trail of destruction in several Caribbean islands and Florida this month, killing at least 84 people.<\/p>\n<p>Photos posted on <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/facebook\/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook<\/a> from St. Croix by Virgin Islands&#8217; local public television station, WTJX-TV, showed fallen utility and telephone poles, tangled wires, uprooted trees and storm shutters ripped from buildings.<\/p>\n<p>In the French territory of Guadeloupe, many roads were blocked and 40% of the population was without power, France&#8217;s overseas territories ministry said.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 21, 2017","published":"2017-09-21 05:55:43","updated":"2017-09-21 05:55:43","minute":"5:55 AM

iPhone 8 calculator to help would-be owners find the best deals on Apple&#8217;s smartphone. The calculator analyzes the total cost of owning an iPhone over two years, including the cost of buying the handset and paying for wireless carrier services.

The highest-priced family plan comes byway of Apple and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/att\/\" target=\"_blank\">AT&amp;T<\/a>, which would cost customers $4,766 after paying 24 monthly payments and plan costs.<\/p>\n<p>The WalletHub study looks at a variety of carrier plans, including those from AT&amp;T <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"T\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a data-type=\"stock-ticker:T\" class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/att\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">T<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, Sprint <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"S\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a data-type=\"stock-ticker:S\" class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/s\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">S<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, T-Mobile <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"TMUS\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a data-type=\"stock-ticker:TMUS\" class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/tmus\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">TMUS<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, Verizon <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"VZ\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a data-type=\"stock-ticker:VZ\" class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/verizon\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">VZ<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, Walmart <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"VZ\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a data-type=\"stock-ticker:VZ\" class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/verizon\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">VZ<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, and Boost Mobile. Its calculator determines whether it&#8217;s better to buy an iPhone 8 outright or pay for it over a two-year period. It also looks at the carriers&#8217; plans and their associated costs.

It&#8217;s followed by T-Mobile and Verizon, which will offer total costs of $2,285 and $2,404 over the period, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Consumers who opt to buy an iPhone 8 on Apple&#8217;s website and sign up for a carrier installment plan there will get the best deal from Sprint at $2,040.<\/p>\n<p>Sprint is similarly offering the best overall pricing on family plans, though at $4,347, it can still be expensive.<\/p>\n<p>However, it&#8217;s important to note that WalletHub&#8217;s calculator makes several assumptions, including with plans. Its data is also based solely on the 64GB iPhone 8. Installment plan pricing also assumes an &#8220;excellent&#8221; credit score, so those who have lower scores might see pricing vary.<\/p>\n<p>You can <a

She\u2019s off in a brisk freestyle crawl\u2014\u201cRace pace!\u201d yells a coach\u2014covering close to half the pool before coming up for air. It\u2019s 7 a.m. at the outdoor community pool in Menlo Park, Calif., where the CEO has been swimming almost every morning since January 2011\u2014just after she lost the race for California governor, just a few months before she took over Hewlett-Packard at the darkest point in its history. She\u2019s not just doing laps; it\u2019s a \u201cboot camp\u2013ish\u201d routine of breaststrokes and freestyle sprints and flip turns, and Whitman, in lane six of the 10-lane pool, is at the center of it all.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\u201cI needed something to take my mind off losing,\u201d she says of her decision to jump back in after three decades away from competitive swimming. By the time she emerges after an hour, glistening and flushed, she\u2019s beaming; standing beside the water in a black, pool-worn one-piece bathing suit, she puts her hands on her hips and turns her face to the morning sun. It\u2019s the ultimate power pose: <i>This is what winning looks like<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">The 61-year-old Whitman hasn\u2019t exactly won yet.

Yet today, about five years after she laid out a five-year plan to rescue HP, her success there is far from assured.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/most-powerful-women\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Meg Whitman is No. 7 on our 2017 list of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business.

But HPE\u2019s revenue has shrunk to an estimated $33 billion this year, and she\u2019s not positive she can get it to grow again.

But it\u2019s not clear how much longer she\u2019ll do that. In June she promoted Antonio Neri, head of HPE\u2019s enterprise group, to president, positioning him as her likely successor. In August she was a top contender to replace Travis Kalanick as CEO of Uber, in which Whitman was an early investor\u2014a job that could have teed her up to eventually lead an unprecedented third <i>Fortune<\/i> 500 company. (The ride-sharing giant went with Dara Khosrowshahi.) And recently she\u2019s been leading on a bigger stage. A lifelong Republican, Whitman switched her support to Hillary Clinton three months before last year\u2019s election\u2014she was the only <i>Fortune<\/i> Most Powerful Woman to publicly campaign for a nominee\u2014stoking speculation that the former gubernatorial candidate would reenter the political arena. \u201cFrankly, I think a leader of every organization now needs to stand up and be counted,\u201d Whitman says. \u201cHistory will judge.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Whitman is still most celebrated for her decade at eBay, which she grew from oddball dotcom startup to e-commerce powerhouse. But the reputation she earned there is the opposite of who she\u2019s become: a turnaround CEO, the grownup who could clean up HP\u2019s mess\u2014and why not Uber\u2019s too? The cynic\u2019s view is that she\u2019s a one-hit wonder, boxed in at a company whose glory days are long behind it. Now, confidants think the intensely competitive Whitman wants another chance to solidify her legacy. Says Neri, \u201cMeg does not like to lose, trust me; she does not like to lose.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-medium-width alignleft\" style=\"max-width:168px;\" ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/screen-shot-2017-09-21-at-5-38-04-pm.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2160818\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/hp-hpe-meg-whitman\/screen-shot-2017-09-21-at-5-38-04-pm\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/screen-shot-2017-09-21-at-5-38-04-pm.png?w=168&#038;h=777\" data-orig-size=\"168,777\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2017-09-21 at 5.38.04 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/screen-shot-2017-09-21-at-5-38-04-pm.png?w=168&#038;h=777?w=65\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/screen-shot-2017-09-21-at-5-38-04-pm.png?w=168&#038;h=777?w=168\" class=\"wp-image-2160818 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/screen-shot-2017-09-21-at-5-38-04-pm.png?w=168&#038;h=777\" alt=\"\" width=\"168\" height=\"777\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\"> Meg Whitman&#8217;s professional experience<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">A hard hat<b>: <\/b><\/span>That\u2019s what Whitman\u2019s new coworkers gave her when she became Hewlett-Packard\u2019s CEO. Covered in stickers bearing idioms such as \u201cCatch a falling knife,\u201d the construction gear sent a not-so-subtle message: In this job, <i>use extreme caution.<\/i><i> <\/i><\/p>\n<p>When she took over in September 2011, HP was enjoying its best year ever, with sales peaking at $127 billion. But it didn\u2019t feel that way. Her predecessor, L\u00e9o Apotheker, had lasted barely 11 months; he had succeeded Mark Hurd, who left <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/hp\/\" target=\"_blank\">Hewlett-Packard<\/a> after being accused of sexual harassment and expense account discrepancies. (Hurd, now co-CEO of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/oracle\/\" target=\"_blank\">Oracle<\/a>, has always denied wrongdoing.) And Apotheker\u2019s $11 billion deal to buy British software company Autonomy would soon go down as one of the worst acquisitions in corporate history, leaving HP with a hangover that included an $8.8 billion write-down.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Whitman, who joined HP\u2019s board in early 2011, turned down the CEO job the first time it was offered. The wounds from her most recent leading role were fresh: As the GOP nominee for California governor, the billionaire had spent 2\u00bd years campaigning and $110 million from her own pocket, only to lose decisively to Jerry Brown in 2010. (\u201cThis is really not good,\u201d Whitman\u2019s neurosurgeon husband remarked upon catching her watching daytime television after the election.) But after a stealth meeting in New Jersey on Sept. 11, 2011, where the board voted to oust Apotheker, Whitman and fellow director Marc Andreessen were on a plane back to San Francisco when the venture capitalist cornered her with a recruitment pitch. \u201cTwo hours in, something in her eyes changed,\u201d Andreessen recalls.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Drawn by what Andreessen calls noblesse oblige, Whitman recognized an opportunity to revive the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/10\/06\/goodbye-hp-meg-whitman\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">faltering legacy of the company that birthed SiliconValley<\/a>: Hewlett-Packard, founded in 1939 in a Palo Alto garage.She had neither tech expertise nor B2B sales experience, but she summoned a sense of patriotic duty: HP was important, she told employees\u2014to them, to the technology industry, and to America itself. \u201cIt had been a long time since the great days of HP,\u201d says Ray Lane, an HPE board member and former HP chairman. \u201cShe went in and got it to remember its groove.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Her first changes were cultural. Whitman doesn\u2019t hide her disdain for the way Hurd\u2014who kept all but his inner circle at arm\u2019s length\u2014ran things. On day two she peeled off the smoke-tinted window film that shielded the C-suite from view and tore down fencing around the executive parking lot. As someone who never had a corner office\u2014or any office\u2014at eBay, she moved everyone to cubicles and plunked down in one herself. Getting staff to open up was like pulling teeth, Whitman says: \u201cThe company was pretty shell-shocked, honestly.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">HP\u2019s problems, she found, were even greater than she had fathomed. Whitman recalls a vacation trekking in New Zealand where she was without cell phone service for almost a week. She exited the wilderness to a string of missed calls from her CFO, who broke the news that revenue and operating income would be billions of dollars lower than expected. In -November 2012 the company\u2019s stock sank below $12, the nadir of her tenure.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe10_c.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2158599\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/hp-hpe-meg-whitman\/meg-whitman-and-supporters-attend-election-night-gathering\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe10_c.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" data-orig-size=\"2880,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Kevork Djansezian&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D3S&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;UNIVERSAL CITY, CA - NOVEMBER 02:  California Republican gubernatorial candidate and former eBay CEO Meg Whitman greets supporters after conceding to governor elect to Jerry Brown during a campaign party on November 2, 2010 in Universal City, California.

Harsh IV (right), greet supporters at an election night party on Nov. 2, 2010. Whitman lost that year\u2019s California gubernatorial election, but some friends believe she will seek office again.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Kevork Djansezian\u2014Getty Images<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">One idea that wasn\u2019t on her rescue road map, but that some investors favored, was splitting the company. Appointing a red team and a blue team to argue the pros and cons, Whitman initially resisted a split. Instead, she looked for efficiencies. In total, she\u2019s eliminated some 75,000 jobs between HP and HPE. Still, customer requests went unresolved in HP\u2019s \u201ctechnology supermarket,\u201d so she promulgated a new motto: \u201cRun to the fire.\u201d Some HP managers found Whitman\u2019s directives patronizing. She reeled in employees who worked remotely. A punctuality zealot, she\u2019d chide staff for starting meetings a couple of minutes late. Some managers were put off when she personally checked their travel schedules. Says one former exec, \u201cWe were all adults there.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Whitman had predicted 2014 would \u201cbe the year you\u2019ll see real recovery and expansion.\u201d But by the time it arrived, a strengthening dollar had sapped international sales, price wars had heated up, and revenue and profits had continued to contract. Amid the bad news, Whitman joined Team Breakup: In October 2014 she announced <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/10\/06\/hewlett-packard-split\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HP would split in half<\/a>. \u201cIt was so obvious to me that these companies were going to be better off alone and they could go faster,\u201d she says.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The old HP, for one, <\/span>might never have gone to Mars. A few months after becoming CEO, Whitman dropped in on HP\u2019s R&amp;D laboratory and asked, \u201cYou got anything we can sell?\u201d The engineers showed her a curiosity that had been seasoning in their skunkworks since 2003. A supercomputer built with an unprecedented 160 terabytes of memory\u2014equivalent to 20,000 laptops\u2014they called it simply \u201cThe Machine.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Today, The Machine, now part of HPE, is the largest R&amp;D project in the history of Hewlett-Packard; Whitman estimates the total cost at more than $500 million. Veteran lab rats consider it their biggest breakthrough since the laser-jet printer. Already its computing prowess is being used to process genetic research data 100 times faster; HPE engineers hope it will one day travel on Mars missions to empower far-flung astronauts to run experiments without contacting Earth. That said, the term \u201cmoonshot\u201d is largely eschewed at HPE. With fingernail profit margins compared to Google\u2019s and Apple\u2019s, the company can\u2019t afford to frivol. \u201cWe\u2019re super-excited about it, but we have to commercialize it,\u201d Whitman says of The Machine.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width alignnone\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe_graphics.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2158892\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/hp-hpe-meg-whitman\/hpe_graphics\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe_graphics.png?w=1024&#038;h=1506\" data-orig-size=\"1220,1794\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"hpe_graphics\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Charts show number of employees and revenues for HPE&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe_graphics.png?w=1024&#038;h=1506?w=204\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe_graphics.png?w=1024&#038;h=1506?w=696\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2158892\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe_graphics.png?w=1024&#038;h=1506\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1506\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe_graphics.png?w=1024&amp;h=1506 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe_graphics.png?w=102&amp;h=150 102w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe_graphics.png?w=204&amp;h=300 204w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe_graphics.png?w=768&amp;h=1129 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe_graphics.png?w=696&amp;h=1024 696w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe_graphics.png 1220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Nicolas Rapp<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Running a smaller company has freed up Whitman to pitch real-life products. She spends 70% of her time meeting with customers, she says. What she lacks in hardware knowledge, she makes up for with her Rolodex: \u201cShe hadn\u2019t sold CEOs servers before, but she knew all the CEOs,\u201d Andreessen says. Whitman cold-calls customers so often that some are initially standoffish, believing they\u2019re being punked. \u201cThe first time it happened, I thought, gosh, that customer is so unfriendly,\u201d she says. Three minutes after hanging up, the customer emailed her: \u201cI just got a call from someone who\u2019s impersonating you!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Still, there are lingering doubts that Whitman\u2019s pavement pounding will restore HPE to an upward trajectory. This year, HPE divested its enterprise services and software divisions, part of what Whitman calls her \u201cvery focused strategy.\u201d But even the CEO doesn\u2019t always sound convinced it will work. Driving to work after her swim, she tells <i>Fortune,<\/i> \u201cI think we need a couple more years to sort of prove out the revenue growth thesis.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">It\u2019s not just Whitman\u2019s legacy at stake, but also that of the company she leads. She has increased value for shareholders, but while each share of HP held since she took over has returned 120% (inclusive of the separation and spinoffs), that lags the S&amp;P 500\u2019s 149%. What\u2019s more, she has boosted share price by dismantling a business. \u201cIn tech, a rule of thumb is, if you\u2019re not growing, you\u2019re dying,\u201d says Steven Milunovich, a managing director at UBS and a longtime enterprise tech analyst. \u201cShe obviously wants to be on the right side of that, but it\u2019s going to be a struggle.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">The competitive landscape, meanwhile, remains brutal. While many businesses are <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/01\/hpe-meg-whitman-servers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">moving data to the cloud<\/a> (using providers such as <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/amazon-com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/microsoft\/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft<\/a>), HPE caters to companies that want on-premises storage. That market is slow-growing and fragmented, and HPE is neck and neck with Dell EMC and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/cisco-systems\/\" target=\"_blank\">Cisco<\/a>, limiting the prices it can charge. The struggle is testing Whitman\u2019s mettle, and as the company shrinks, some former colleagues now see her as merely a financial engineer, gifted at execution but lacking vision.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Whitman\u2019s advocates praise her for making the tough choices necessary to assure Hewlett-Packard\u2019s future. Still, even defenders see the best-case trajectory under Whitman as one of soft landings, not interplanetary ascents. \u201cThe question is, could you have gotten your mojo back, and could HP have been great again as a $100 billion company?\u201d asks Lane, the board member. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">For a leader <\/span><span class=\"s2\">familiar with the hard knocks of politics, Whitman has been unafraid to flip-flop. <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/10\/30\/bye-bye-hp\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deciding to split HP<\/a> was one reversal; another was her Democratic defection after Chris Christie, her GOP candidate of choice, bowed out. Her courtship at scandal-plagued Uber may have been another<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">In July she <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/28\/meg-whitman-uber-hpe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">publicly took herself out of the running for Kalanick\u2019s job<\/a>, tweeting, \u201cUber\u2019s CEO will not be Meg Whitman.\u201d As an investor in the startup, she had advised Kalanick and his deputies for years, and after his June resignation she had offered her counsel again. Some on the board saw in her his ideal replacement, despite, she claims, her lack of interest. \u201cI wasn\u2019t that attracted,\u201d she told me in mid-August. Though she can see why they\u2019d want her: \u201cI have marketplace experience, I have political experience, I have big complex experience, and I\u2019ve changed cultures. Right? So, there\u2019s sort of a natural, like, \u2018Wow, Meg would be great.\u2019\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe10_b.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2158597\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/hp-hpe-meg-whitman\/hpe10_b\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe10_b.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" data-orig-size=\"2880,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5.6&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Brinson+Banks&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;PENTAX 645Z&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman keeps a swim cap at her desk at the Hewlett Packard Corporate Headquarters in Palo Alto, California September 13, 2017. \\r\\rCredit: Brinson+Banks&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1505319205&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Brinson+Banks&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;55&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;1600&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.008&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Meg Whitman HPE swim cap\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman keeps a swim cap at her desk at the Hewlett Packard Corporate Headquarters in Palo Alto, California September 13, 2017. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Credit: Brinson+Banks&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe10_b.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe10_b.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=1024\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2158597\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/hpe10_b.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\"Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman keeps a swim cap at her desk at the Hewlett Packard Corporate Headquarters in Palo Alto, California September 13, 2017.

She took up swimming again to reenergize after a failed political run: \u201cI needed something to take my mind off losing.\u201d<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Brinson+Banks<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p3\">A week after our meeting, it seems, Whitman warmed to the idea as well. On the evening of Friday, Aug. 25, following Uber\u2019s interviews with other candidates, two board members called Whitman. What would it take, they asked, for you to reconsider? On Saturday she gave her ultimatums\u2014including resolving the board\u2019s lawsuits and installing better governance.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Uber hired Expedia\u2019s CEO, Khosrowshahi, instead. The ride-sharing company\u2019s growth possibilities, Whitman said in a statement afterward, \u201cremind me of eBay in its early days,\u201d but \u201cit wasn\u2019t the right thing.\u201d She reasserted her commitment to HPE, but she didn\u2019t dispel the perception that some part of her would rather work for an Uber. Some expect she could leave HPE by the end of the year. Heidrick &amp; Struggles, the headhunting firm that conducted Uber\u2019s search, wouldn\u2019t comment on Whitman\u2019s prospects, citing its \u201cpolicy of not commenting on candidates or companies engaging in a search.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">So what\u2019s next for Whitman? \u201cShe\u2019s born to run large organizations,\u201d Andreessen says. \u201cI think she\u2019s happiest when she\u2019s doing that.\u201d Which raises the question of politics: There are few organizations larger than the United States, after all. <\/span>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Meg ended up the first female President,\u201d says Bob Kagle, a cofounder of venture capital firm Benchmark, who helped recruit Whitman to eBay. <span class=\"s2\">Indeed, Whitman says she saw elements of herself in Clinton\u2014members of \u201cthe same generation of women who were pioneering.\u201d After rebuking Donald Trump last year as a \u201cdishonest demagogue,\u201d Whitman refused a post-election invitation to join one of his now-disbanded business councils. She has since slammed Trump\u2019s actions on the Paris climate accord, white supremacist violence, and immigration. She deflects accusations of betrayal from Republicans. \u201cI haven\u2019t turned my back on the party,\u201d she says. \u201cI would say maybe the party has turned their back on me.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Whitman won\u2019t rule out being CEO of another company; she had ruled it out after eBay, she points out, and now look where we are. Ask her whether she\u2019d run for President, however, and a look like she ate a sour cherry comes over her face. A political appointment, maybe, but running for office? \u201cI\u2019m definitely not doing that.\u201d But given Whitman\u2019s history, you can never say never.<\/p>\n<p><em>A version of this

Morgan<\/a> CEO for his views on the cryptocurrency, Jamie Dimon is doubling down once again on his call that Bitcoin is a &#8220;fraud.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In a CNBC interview Friday, Dimon labeled Bitcoin a &#8220;novelty&#8221; with no real value.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Right now these crypto things are kind of a novelty. People think they&#8217;re kind of neat. But the bigger they get, the more governments are going to close them down,&#8221; the CEO told CNBC. &#8220;It&#8217;s creating something out of nothing that to me is worth nothing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price is now hovering around $3,600, down from an all-time high of $5,000 earlier this month. The cryptocurrency took a plunge after Chinese officials cracked down on bitcoin, banned ICOs and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/15\/china-shutting-down-beijing-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-exchanges\/\">closed down cryptocurrency exchanges<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/12\/jamie-dimon-beats-up-on-bitcoin-says-its-a-fraud\/\">Around the same time<\/a>, Dimon also <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/12\/jamie-dimon-beats-up-on-bitcoin-says-its-a-fraud\/\">reasserted his view from 2015<\/a> that Bitcoin is a fraud that will &#8220;blow up.&#8221; He reasoned the cryptocurrency was best suited for illicit uses, likely triggering crackdowns from world governments.<\/p>\n<p>Separately, London-based Blockswater, which trades Bitcoin, lodged a complaint with Swedish authorities Thursday in which it accused Dimon of manipulating the price of Bitcoin. The allegations were made after Reuters reported that J.P. Morgan <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"jpm\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a data-type=\"stock-ticker:jpm\" class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/j-p-morgan-chase\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">jpm<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> had been routing customer orders for an exchange-traded note tracking Bitcoin.

Our findings were bleak.<\/p>\n<p>The divide between the wealth of a typical black family and a typical white family today is vast. A median black family has just $1,700 in wealth\u2014total assets minus total debt. Thirty years ago, that same family had $6,800 in today\u2019s dollars. Latino families at the median have similarly small assets, just $2,000, and also saw a decline over the past three decades.<\/p>\n<p>White median household wealth, meanwhile, is significantly higher: $116,800, up from $102,000 over the same period.<\/p>\n<p>So black and Latino families at the middle have seen their wealth slip while white families in the middle saw their wealth rise. What does this look like projected into the future?<\/p>\n<p>By 2053, just 10 years after the country is projected to become majority non-white, black median families will own zero wealth if current trends continue. Twenty years later, Latino median families will follow suit. White median families will continue to own six figures.<\/p>\n<p>Even those black and Latino families who\u2019ve achieved the traditional markers of middle class life\u2014a good-paying job and a college degree\u2014still lag far behind their white counterparts in terms of wealth. Black and Latino families with a member holding a four-year degree own just a fifth of the wealth of equivalent white families. In fact, they own less wealth than a white family whose head has just a high school diploma.<\/p>\n<p>These numbers represent a troubling trend in which assets and economic opportunities are channeled away from families of color and toward white families.<\/p>\n<p>The enduring legacy of slavery and the Jim Crow era contribute to this growing divide. For instance, just 2% of the heavily subsidized mortgages made available by the Federal Housing Administration in the 30 years following the Great Depression went to non-white households. Homes are the biggest asset most middle-class families own, so this sort of federally sanctioned discrimination created a huge, intergenerational disadvantage for the black and Latino families left out.<\/p>\n<p>Modern public policy decisions rooted in expanding inequality also play a significant role. One such policy is America\u2019s complex system of tax expenditures\u2014essentially discounts handed out to certain groups and individuals that together total more than a half a trillion dollars in public spending each year.<\/p>\n<p>One example is the mortgage interest deduction, a tax break designed to promote homeownership. Unfortunately, the deduction is only available to those who itemize their tax returns, which skews the beneficiaries heavily toward the already wealthy\u2014who are disproportionally white.<\/p>\n<p>Changing our priorities around tax incentives, as well as investments in bold new programs like Children\u2019s Savings Accounts (CSA) and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jacobinmag.com\/2017\/02\/federal-job-guarantee-universal-basic-income-investment-jobs-unemployment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">federal jobs guarantee<\/a>, could reverse the decades-long rise in the racial wealth divide. Had Congress instituted a robust universal CSA program in 1979\u2014seeding small savings and investment accounts for all children that could mature as they grew older\u2014the white-Latino wealth gap would have disappeared by now and the white-black gap would have dropped by 82%.<\/p>\n<p>Policy changes like these would require bold leadership from across the federal government, including Congress and the White House. In today\u2019s political atmosphere, marked most often by scandal and regressive policy decrees as well as congressional gridlock, this does not appear forthcoming.<\/p>\n<p>The good news, however, is that the policies needed to begin to turn the tide on our growing divide are readily at hand. We know what the problem is and how to fix it. Building the political will, and political power, to put such policies in play is the next step.<\/p>\n<p><em>Josh Hoxie is director of the Project on Opportunity and Taxation at the Institute for

That&#8217;s the biggest drop in 16 years. That&#8217;s due, in large part, to the return of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/06\/t-mobile-raising-price-unlimited\/\">unlimited plans<\/a> by carriers.<\/p>\n<p>All major carrier offer those these days (even though <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/verizon\/\" target=\"_blank\">Verizon<\/a> had to be dragged back to unlimited kicking and screaming). The good news is, experts say they don&#8217;t expect them to fade away.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think unlimited is the future,&#8221; says Jeff Kagan, a telecom industry analyst. &#8220;That&#8217;s what keeps the customer using services and not worrying about what its going to cost them. &#8230; It&#8217;s a bumpy road, but we&#8217;re headed in that direction.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The rates for those plans could go up, however. While Sprint and T-Mobile target Verizon and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/att\/\" target=\"_blank\">AT&amp;T<\/a> in their commercials, they&#8217;re largely competing against each other, says Kagan, since both are trying to lure customers away from the two giants of the industry. Should they become a single company, the incentive to lower prices would decrease.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The question is: Will they need to still provide savings? And if they do, will the savings be as great as they are now?,&#8221; Kagan says. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see this being helpful on price. If anything, prices will stay the same or go up.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There may not be refuge with smaller carriers like Cricket Wireless or MetroPCS, either, since those companies buy network access from larger carriers at a wholesale price and then resell it. If those prices increase because of the merger, so too would those of &#8220;bargain&#8221; phone companies.<\/p>\n<p>One notable advantage for customers of both T-Mobile and Sprint will be the upgrade to network coverage. Both services have invested heavily in their network in recent years, so a merger would create a number three company that could better compete against AT&amp;T and Verizon.<\/p>\n<p>The hiccup there is the two companies use different technologies to power their 2G networks &#8211; CDMA for Sprint and GSM for T-Mobile. And most phones that use CDMA networks don&#8217;t have SIM cards, which could force customers to get a new phone.<\/p>\n<p>Then again, it could be the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/19\/apple-iphone-8-preorders-disappoint\/\">excuse customers were looking for<\/a> to buy an iPhone 8.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 22, 2017","published":"2017-09-22 11:29:53","updated":"2017-09-22 11:29:53","minute":"11:29 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/t-mobile-sprint-merger-customers\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/t-mobile-sprint-merger-customers\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/t-mobile-sprint-merger-customers\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"What Would a T-Mobile Sprint Merger Mean for Customers?","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"34\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5484697528001-34\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5484697528001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2xmPHwb\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dchartercommunications%2Ccomcast%2Csprint%2Csprintwireless%2Ctmobile%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dsprint&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"excerpt":"<p>Wider network coverage, yes, but there are costs.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"930817","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/chris-morris\/","name":"Chris Morris","twitter":"","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/cmorris.png?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/cmorris.png?w=59 59w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/cmorris.png?w=118 118w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 59px) 100vw, 59px\" data-attachment-id=\"2139856\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/?attachment_id=2139856\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/cmorris.png\" data-orig-size=\"200,200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"cmorris\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/cmorris.png?w=200\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/cmorris.png?w=200\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/cmorris.png?w=150",150,150,true],"bio":"For over 25 years, Chris Morris has covered the quirky side of business, touching on everything from gadgets to video games to beer to porn.

At its peak it was a Category 5 cyclone with winds of up to 185 miles per hour. (The last devastating Category 5 storm to hit Florida was <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/05\/hurricane-andrew-photo-damage\/\">Hurricane Andrew<\/a> in 1992.)<\/p>\n<p>Hurricane Irma made landfall this weekend, lashing Florida with 130 m.p.h. winds as it moved up the coast. A weakened Irma has since been downgraded to a tropical storm, but challenging conditions persist. Approximately 13 million people were without electricity because of Irma, with nearly every corner of Florida feeling the storm&#8217;s wrath.<\/p>\n<p>Florida, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/06\/hurricane-irma-in-storms-path-georgia-declares-a-state-of-emergency\/\">Georgia<\/a>, and South Carolina have all declared a state of emergency. Irma first struck the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/07\/hurricane-irma-damage-barbuda\/\">tiny island of Barbuda<\/a> in the Caribbean, leaving the island &#8220;barely habitable,&#8221; according to its prime minister. A number of properties owned by Donald Trump are also at risk, including <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/06\/hurricane-irma-mar-a-lago\/\">Mar-a-Lago<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Many residents are also facing <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/06\/florida-fuel-shortages-irma\/\">fuel shortages<\/a>. Gas stations are struggling to keep up with demand, driving gas prices in Florida up to $2.71 a gallon.<\/p>\n<p>And Irma isn&#8217;t alone. <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/06\/satellite-hurricane-irma-jose-and-katia-atlantic\/\">Hurricanes Katia and Jose\u2014<\/a>Category 1 and Category 2 storms, respectively\u2014have emerged. Katia is expected to reach Mexico&#8217;s coast by Thursday and Jose is predicted to become more powerful by the weekend.<\/p>\n<p><em>Click through the gallery to see photos from the impact of

But it&#8217;s still early for a lot of the activities, so what can you do? Here are five ways to make the most of your first fall weekend.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Buy your pumpkin now.<\/h3>\n<p>Not to start off autumn with an alarm, but if the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/11\/26\/thanksgiving-pumpkin-shortage\/\">Great Thanksgiving Pumpkin Shortage of 2015<\/a> is any indicator, you may want to buy your pumpkin early this year. In October 2015, it appeared there would be a pumpkin shortage by Thanksgiving, due to higher-than-normal rainfall during June&#8217;s growing season in Morton, Ill., where approximately 85% of the country&#8217;s orange squashes come from. That caused a panic, though eventually everyone got their fill.<\/p>\n<p>Last year <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/09\/25\/2016-pumpkin-crop\/\">the crop rebounded nicely<\/a>, but this year, Morton&#8217;s rainfall is higher than it was in 2016, (though less than it was in 2015). The long and short of it is this: Buy your grocery store pumpkins sooner rather than later, unless you&#8217;re out of your gourd. (Note: Technically speaking, pumpkins aren&#8217;t gourds.)<\/p>\n<h3>2. Plant next summer\u2019s lawn today.<\/h3>\n<p>Want the neighbors to be green with envy over your grass next summer? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scotts.com\/en-us\/library\/lawn-basics\/important-lawn-maintenance-projects-fall\">Start putting in the work today<\/a>, say the lawn wranglers over at Scotts. The best way to ensure that your grass remains healthy, strong, and well established come summertime is to begin working on it in autumn.<\/p>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t already, start by feeding your grass, something that ideally you should&#8217;ve been done in early September. Once that&#8217;s done and absorbed into the soil, reseed your lawn to patch all the holes left behind after a summer of hard playing in the yard. Then, a month or two after the first feeding, you&#8217;ll want to give the grass another dose of fertilizer to carry it through the colder months. The air may only be a little crisp at the moment, but as they say in <em>Game of Thrones, <\/em>&#8220;Winter is coming.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>3. Be first to the pumpkin patch.<\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re one for picking your own pumpkin, plan to get there before the crowds because\u2014and not to sound like an overbearing parent here\u2014there will be crowds. That means pack the car the night before, wake up and leave early, make sure you have snacks and water, and be ready for traffic, because parking at u-pick farms can be scarier than anything you&#8217;ll see at Halloween.<\/p>\n<p>That said, there are a lot of patches to hit, just visit <a href=\"http:\/\/pumpkinpatchguide.com\/\">The Pumpkin Patch Guide<\/a> to find one near you. And if you&#8217;re not going to be first, at least be well prepared by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Mac-Sports-Collapsible-Folding-Outdoor\/dp\/B00BUUUIGK\">buying a collapsable outdoor utility wagon<\/a>, which is great for hauling pumpkins, toddlers, or both.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Plan for peak fall foliage.<\/h3>\n<p>Optimal leaf-peeping time isn&#8217;t yet upon us, but if you want to sneak a peak at the current conditions near you or around the country, The Weather Channel has rolled out its <a href=\"https:\/\/weather.com\/maps\/fall-foliage\">Fall Foliage Maps for 2017<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As of this writing, (and depending on where you&#8217;re reading this from) the scenery still looks sparse. But you can forecast when the <a href=\"https:\/\/smokymountains.com\/fall-foliage-map\/\">colors will begin to pop<\/a> in your area using this guide from The Smoky Mountains. Keep in mind, the website notes, &#8220;While no tool can be 100% accurate, this tool is meant to help travelers better time their trips to have the best opportunity of catching peak color each year.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>5. Enjoy pumpkin spice everything.<\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of Starbuck&#8217;s pumpkin spice lattes, you already know the Seattle-based coffee chain has been <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/08\/10\/starbucks-pumpkin-spice-latte-2\/\">pushing their signature fall drink<\/a> since August. (And if you&#8217;re not, you can cozy up to their new alternative, the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/21\/starbucks-new-flavor-maple-pecan-latte\/\">maple pecan latte<\/a>.) But there&#8217;s more, like Krispy Kreme doughnuts (sorry, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/05\/krispy-kreme-pumpkin-doughnut-one-day-only\/\">you missed them<\/a>), <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/08\/25\/pumpkin-flavors-earlier\/\">craft beer<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/20\/pumpkin-spice-cheerios\/\">Cheerios<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/pumpkin-spice-pizza\/\">pizza<\/a> of course, and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/14\/pumpkin-spice-spray\/\">even body spray<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>With all these products, it begs the question: Why are we <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/08\/starbucks-pumpkin-spice-latte-obsession\/\">so obsessed with pumpkin spice?<\/a> Sadly, no one has time to answer.

The new <a href=\"https:\/\/cvshealth.com\/thought-leadership\/cvs-health-enterprise-response-opioid-epidemic\/cvs-health-responds-to-nations-opioid-crisis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CVS opioid policy<\/a> will limit many prescriptions to seven days and prioritize lower-dose and instant release formulations of the painkillers to reduce the risk of addiction and overdoses.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Without a doubt, addressing our nation&#8217;s opioid crisis calls for a multipronged effort involving many health care stakeholders, from doctors, dentists and pharmaceutical companies to pharmacies and government officials,&#8221; said CVS Health CEO Larry Merlo in a statement announcing the initiative.<\/p>\n<p>The CVS opioid policy will affect how the powerful pain-numbing drugs are distributed through its more than 9,600 pharmacies across the U.S. beginning in February 2018. For instance, patients who are prescribed opioids for certain acute medical conditions like (relatively) minor injuries would be given a one-week limited prescription at a reasonable dosage level. Extended release opioids would only be a secondary option after an instant release prescription has been dispensed.<\/p>\n<p>The initiative will also bolster pharmacist training and awareness programs about opioids, and CVS will add in-store medicine disposal units at 750 pharmacies so that patients can safely throw leftover pills away.<\/p>\n<p>An increasing number of medical industry players are starting to get serious about tackling the opioid epidemic which killed 33,000 Americans in 2015 alone.

Viewers\u2019 loyalty to their favorite teams and the tradition of watching games on Sunday afternoons (and Monday nights) provided stability and certainty for stakeholders across the TV ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p>Mass-market advertisers could plan fall marketing campaigns knowing that NFL games would reach just about everyone. Broadcasters and cable channels (such as ESPN) could enter into long-term deals for broadcast rights knowing that people would \u201calways\u201d want to watch football, creating an anchor tenant for the rest of their programming lineup. Last but not least, pay TV providers have long used their exclusive distribution rights to NFL games as both a carrot (to attract new subscribers as DirecTV did with its wildly successful Sunday Ticket package in the 1990s) and a stick (to keep existing households from canceling service regardless of the cost or frustration many folks have with their pay TV provider).<\/p>\n<p>The question today, however, is what if this entire edifice is just a house of cards? NFL ratings have fallen significantly across all providers over the past seasons and so far 2017 is not looking any better. The only positive element to that decline may be that fewer people have to watch the sad sight of the Los Angeles Rams playing in front of a mostly empty stadium at the Coliseum. There are endless theories about the decline, from the rising popularity of video games to player safety to (ridiculously) the Colin Kaepernick situation.<\/p>\n<p>My own view is that declining NFL ratings are the logical outgrowth of the decline in legacy linear television overall. This larger decline has been going on for over a decade now; is rooted in a fundamental shift to anytime, anywhere viewing on broadband devices; and affects all legacy TV programming to one degree or another. In short, contrary to the hopes (or delusions) of some in the TV industry, the NFL is not immune to these larger societal and viewing dynamics.<\/p>\n<p>The more important question is: What happens to the pay TV edifice when the NFL cornerstone isn\u2019t there anymore? The answers are multiple, but two are particularly important.<\/p>\n<p>First, the link between household growth and pay TV growth has been irreparably broken. The creation of a new household\u2014most commonly by a young adult leaving home\u2014used to almost automatically result in an additional pay TV household. That is simply no longer the case. Millions of American households are living happily without pay TV and one of the reasons is that Monday Night Football and other NFL games are simply no longer must-see TV. Put another way, U.S. legacy pay TV households have peaked and will only decline going forward.<\/p>\n<p>The second effect of declining NFL ratings is the slow collapse of the supersize pay TV bundle itself. If the NFL isn\u2019t must-have content, then nothing is must-have content. The result is a mushrooming of skinny bundles from providers as varied as Sling TV, DirecTV Now, PlayStation Vue, YouTube TV, and Hulu\u2019s Live TV.<\/p>\n<p>These services vary pretty dramatically, seemingly agreeing only on three things: people want cheaper pay TV offerings; what people want varies (including access to the NFL); and half a loaf (in terms of monthly subscription fees) is a whole lot better than none.<\/p>\n<p><em>Joel Espelien is a senior analyst at <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tdgresearch.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>The Diffusion Group<\/em><\/a><em>. <\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 20, 2017","published":"2017-09-20 04:32:42","updated":"2017-09-20 04:32:42","minute":"4:32 PM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/20\/nfl-monday-night-football-tv-ratings-decline\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/20\/nfl-monday-night-football-tv-ratings-decline\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/20\/nfl-monday-night-football-tv-ratings-decline\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"42\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5420967886001-42\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5420967886001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2xRFonc\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/health_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dbrainstormhealth%2Cdarrellstuckey%2Clachargers%2Cnfl%2Csports%2Cwearabletechnology%2Cwearables%26ch%3Dhealth%26topic%3Dbrainstormhealth&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"excerpt":"<p>Football ratings show no signs of reviving.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"2159265","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/joel-espelien\/","name":"Joel Espelien","twitter":"","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":false,"thumbnail_alt":false,"thumbnail_src":false,"bio":"Joel Espelien is a senior analyst at The Diffusion Group.","title":"","company":"","is_contributor":"not-contributor"}],"sections":[{"term_id":447823559,"name":"Fortune Insiders","slug":"fortune-insiders","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":122920,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Ideas from the brightest minds in business.","parent":0,"count":3779,"filter":"raw"}],"section":{},"tags":[{"term_id":271,"name":"Commentary","slug":"commentary","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":111707,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":4920,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":1371,"name":"NFL","slug":"nfl","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":55617,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":388,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":459,"name":"Television","slug":"television","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46884,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":581,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":174153,"name":"TV ratings","slug":"tv-ratings","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":115952,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":38,"filter":"raw"}],"has_commentary_tag":true,"primary_tag":{},"f500_tag":false,"paid":false,"paid_excerpt":"Football ratings show no signs of reviving.","seo":{"seo_title":"NFL Ratings Decline: Football Can't Keep TV Afloat Anymore","seo_description":"The NFL's ratings are in a deep decline and show no sign of improving in 2017.

That&#8217;s the single biggest private financing round for a health care company ever. And the former hedge funder-turned-biotech CEO is dead set on using it to help Roivant succeed in a new approach to drug development\u2014with the help of an impressive cadre of long-time bipopharma vets who have bought in to the ambitious wunderkind&#8217;s vision.<\/p>\n<p><em>Fortune <\/em>spoke with Ramaswamy and four of his member company CEOs to discuss how Roivant&#8217;s brash, ambitious model seduced long-time pros who know the heartaches of trying to create groundbreaking drugs.<\/p>\n<p>Roivant has a fascinating <a href=\"http:\/\/roivant.com\/about-us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">structure and modus operandi<\/a> which sets it apart from the thousands of pharma outfits which have cropped up over the years. For one, Roivant itself is an umbrella organization which houses <a href=\"http:\/\/roivant.com\/about-us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a federation of drug and health care companies<\/a>, each of which is focused on a different area of medical development and comes with the &#8220;Vant&#8221; suffix. Axovant is focused on Alzheimer&#8217;s and dementia; Myovant on women&#8217;s health; Enzyvant on rare diseases; Dermavant on skin conditions; and Urovant on urological disorders. There&#8217;s also a Datavant focused on health care data and analytics and multiple other arms planned for the future, including in the digital health space, Ramaswamy tells <em>Fortune.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Ramaswamy and his motley crew of life science executives say this structure allows the companies to work under a model which facilitates both collaboration and flexibility; each firm can pursue its own needs, but can also rely on broader Roivant resources to fuel operations and new ideas. For instance, Ramaswamy has taken some of these companies public (i.e., Axovant and Myovant, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/06\/biotech-merck-ramaswamy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">which had blockbuster IPOs<\/a>) to raise cash while keeping others private. &#8220;For some companies, going public makes the most sense. For others, remaining private is preferable.

Unlike traditional pharmaceuticals, its member companies don&#8217;t try to start from scratch; rather, they scoop up experimental treatments abandoned by other pharma companies for one reason or another\u2014incompatibility with the overall drug pipeline, the expenses of late-stage clinical trials, a general lack of enthusiasm, justified or not, surrounding an experimental therapy\u2014through acquisitions and licensing deals in order to shepherd them through the regulatory process.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, Urovant has a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/06\/biotech-merck-ramaswamy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bladder disease treatment<\/a> licensed from pharma giant <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/merck\/\" target=\"_blank\">Merck<\/a>.

In fact, in some ways, the entire model is a proof of concept.

They share decades of medical, biopharma, and overall corporate industry experience between them and have been involved in cutting edge life science innovation over the years. So just what makes them so confident in Ramaswamy and Roivant?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Energy, intellect, and passion,&#8221; says Seely. &#8220;I came to Myovant by serendipity and at the end of the day was just completely energized by what they were trying to do. This concept of creating value by more efficient and effective drug development and commercialization. And so I think it was really that the energy and passion that convinced me to come here.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Shih nods his head in agreement. &#8220;The other thing that really drove my decision was the chance to make an impact on patients&#8217; lives in a very directed, very efficient, and very quick way, especially for people suffering from rare diseases,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very focused version of drug development that cuts out a lot of the clutter.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This is an argument made by all of the Roivant CEOs. There&#8217;s a sense that the company has the can-do moxie of a startup\u2014except one that&#8217;s led by people with decades of scientific and pharma industry know-how. &#8220;Everything that\u2019s done here starts at the science level. Science and unmet medical need\u2014it\u2019s not just repurposing drugs just to say we have something,&#8221; as Fouse puts it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getbrainstormhealth\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Click here<\/em><\/a> <em>to subscribe to Brainstorm Health Daily, our brand new newsletter about health innovations.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>None of the Roivant firms actually have a drug on the market yet. But their experimental candidates have shown at least some semblance of promise in previous trials, according to the CEOs. Some, like the Axovant Alzheimer&#8217;s therapy intepirdine, just may not have been tried out in the right doses or with the right patient pools, says Hung. When asked how he thinks Axovant succeed in a disease space where so many others have failed, Hung replies, &#8220;In general, you have to take a diversified approach when it comes to complex illnesses.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Key data from a late-stage trial of intepirdine is due this month, and it could prove a make-or-break moment for Axovant and Roivant at large.

In fact, one product didn&#8217;t last four years, being rendered obsolete on the last day of its third year.<\/p>\n<p>iPad 4 is the sole new <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/apple\/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple<\/a> tablet model unable to take the iOS 11 update. That means the device will join every older model in not being able to receive new features. Originally launched Nov. 2, 2012, the device was powered by the now-aging A6x processor, which is a 32-bit chip. iOS 11 is a 64-bit operating system, which is why the tablet will not be receiving further updates.<\/p>\n<p>On the smartphone side, iPhone 5 will also be mothballed by the new operating system. Released Sept. 21, 2012, the handset was the last one overseen by Steve Jobs. It boasts the Apple A6 processor, which lacks the graphics might of the A6X, but is also a 32-bit chip and is otherwise similar.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, iOS 11 will be unavailable for iPhone 5Cs, the low-cost smartphone model released by Apple on Sept. 20, 2013. Though it&#8217;s a year younger than the iPhone 5, the 5C also used the 32-bit Apple A6 processor (helping to keep its costs down), which is why they are both being retired at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>Released alongside the iPhone 5C, the iPhone 5S has a 64-bit Apple A7 processor which is compatible with the new iOS 11 operating system. As a result, owners of that model will be able to update their handsets to the new system\u2014for now, at least.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT201624\">According to Apple&#8217;s official designations<\/a>, none of the above models are actually &#8220;obsolete.&#8221; But since they will not be receiving the new features of the iOS 11 operating system, for all intents and purposes, they effectively are retired.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 18, 2017","published":"2017-09-18 04:53:51","updated":"2017-09-18 04:53:51","minute":"4:53 PM

CEO of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/mattel\/\" target=\"_blank\">Mattel<\/a>, is an unlikely leader for the 72-year-old toy manufacturer: The exec, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/mattel-ceo-most-powerful-women\/\">profiled in the latest issue of <em>Fortune<\/em><\/a> and No. 49 on <em>Fortune<\/em>&#8216;s <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/most-powerful-women\/\">Most Powerful Women list<\/a>, doesn\u2019t come from a consumer products industry, but rather from <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/alphabet\/\" target=\"_blank\">Google<\/a>. Georgiadis spent nearly a decade at the search giant, including six years as the head of the Silicon Valley company\u2019s sales and operations in the Americas.<\/p>\n<p>Now, at Mattel&#8217;s helm, she is tasked with bringing the maker of Barbie and Hot Wheels into the digital age. Not surprisingly, some of her first moves as CEO are undeniably \u201cGoogly\u201d\u2014not only pushing a tech-centric approach but also instituting a faster and less hierarchical culture. Here are five ways Georgiadis is Googlifying Mattel:<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Beefing up tech chops <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Earlier this summer, Georgiadis brought in a new chief technology officer: Sven Gerjets, the former CIO of Time Warner Cable. All of Mattel&#8217;s existing technology resources have now been consolidated under Gerjets, who is now vetting all the various tech-focused initiatives at the company. Another big task for Gerjets? Hiring more software developers and other tech talent.<\/p>\n<p><em>To learn more about how technology is shaking up big toymakers, read &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/mattel-ceo-most-powerful-women\/\">Can a Tech Makeover Save the Toy Industry<\/a>?&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Meeting customers where they are <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>From marketing to consumers to distribution, most elements of doing business have been moving online for quite some time. But it took a Google exec to force Mattel to part ways with the past. Before Georgiadis took over, most of the toy company&#8217;s advertising spend was going to traditional television ads. The new CEO has now instituted a rule that says there needs to be a 50\/50 split between TV and digital dollars. &#8220;We can still have television,&#8221; Georgiadis tells <em>Fortune<\/em>. &#8220;But we&#8217;ve got to optimize it, to at least get reach. And we&#8217;ve got to give a significant portion to digital.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Building &#8216;platforms,&#8217; not one-off products<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Mattel had successfully experimented with developing tech-centric toys in the past. But the company hadn&#8217;t taken a &#8220;platform&#8221; approach to the task. A platform, in non-jargony words, is a set of software tools that lets you iterate on the same technology&#8211;say, a smart computer system that can follow commands from a child&#8217;s voice&#8211;without having to reinvent the wheel every time you develop a new product. Georgiadis is changing that. &#8220;It&#8217;s no different than in tech, right?&#8221; she says. &#8220;In tech you create the foundation, even sometimes if it doesn&#8217;t work, you take that same developmental idea and you use it to apply to a different area.&#8221; Spoken like a true Googler.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>A new &#8216;Rule of Two&#8217;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>To speed up decision-making, Georgiadis has implemented her &#8220;Rule of Two.&#8221; This states that decisions can be made with just two senior people in a room, rather than four or five&#8211;as would have been the case at the old Mattel. &#8220;There was just a lot of friction lost in the complexity of the structure, and reasons for things not to get done&#8211;not because anyone did not have good intentions, but there wasn&#8217;t a referee,&#8221; says Georgiadis. The goal? To get Mattel thinking, and more importantly <em>acting<\/em>, faster than ever.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Simplifying supply chains<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Here, Georgiadis is borrowing not just from her experience at Google but also from her insights from fast food chain <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/mcdonalds\/\" target=\"_blank\">McDonald&#8217;s<\/a>, where she has been a director since 2015. &#8220;People think it&#8217;s so easy to make hamburgers,&#8221; she says. &#8220;That consistent quality in so many restaurants, in that many parts of the world, is not an easy thing to do.&#8221; Georgiadis has tasked her head of supply chain, Peter Gibbons, to automate more of Mattel&#8217;s processes, from logistics to procurement. The good news? Gibbons comes from another supply chain master: <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/starbucks\/\" target=\"_blank\">Starbucks<\/a>.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 22,

Demand for <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/15\/apple-iphone-8-preorders\/\">preorders of the iPhone 8<\/a> and 8 Plus that started on Friday have been disappointing, the people said, as more customers may be holding out for Apple&#8217;s premium iPhone X model.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve never been in this situation before, where Apple has announced two devices coming out within six weeks of each other,&#8221; an official at one carrier said.<\/p>\n<p>Apple did not return a request for comment. The major carriers\u2014AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile\u2014weren&#8217;t saying much about iPhone 8 preorders, either. &#8220;It&#8217;s clear customers are super excited about Apple&#8217;s new products and so are we,&#8221; a spokeswoman for T-Mobile said. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking forward to yet another successful launch with Apple.&#8221; <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/att\/\" target=\"_blank\">AT&amp;T<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/verizon\/\" target=\"_blank\">Verizon<\/a>, and Sprint declined to comment.<\/p>\n<p>Apple unveiled the iPhone 8 and X at <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/go\/tech\/apple-iphone-8-event-recap\/\">a press event on its new Apple Park campus<\/a> last week and preorders for the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus began on Friday. These new iPhones look much like Apple&#8217;s models from the past three years, though with faster processors, better cameras, and a glass back instead of aluminum to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/08\/iphone-8-apple-wireless-inductive-charging\/\">support inductive charging<\/a>. Apple also decided to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/12\/iphone-8-x-price-hike\/\">slightly raise the price<\/a> of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus from the comparable devices last year.<\/p>\n<p>But the iPhone X\u2014which has an all-new exterior design, sharper OLED display, and a price tag starting at $999\u2014isn&#8217;t immediately available.

Kuo noted that shipping delays of only one week or so currently showing on Apple&#8217;s web site for the iPhone 8 are much less than the three- to six-week delays seen after earlier iPhone launches.<\/p>\n<p>Overestimating demand for the iPhone 8 models could hurt Apple if it produced too many units for sale ahead of time or can&#8217;t keep pace with higher-than-expected demand for the iPhone X model. But if Apple can produce enough of the iPhone X to satisfy the demand, it could beat the forecasts by selling more of the high-priced model than analysts expected.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getdatasheet\/\">Get Data Sheet<\/a>, Fortune&#8217;s technology newsletter.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Analysts <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/08\/iphone-8-apple-stock-price\/\">are counting on robust sales<\/a> of the iPhone 8 models to help Apple <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"aapl\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a data-type=\"stock-ticker:aapl\" class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/apple\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">aapl<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> meet its revenue prediction of between $49 billion and $52 billion for the current quarter, the company&#8217;s fiscal fourth quarter of 2017 which ends at the end of this month. Sales would need to increase from last year by 4% to 11% to meet the forecast.<\/p>\n<p>The bigger question is how iPhone oversupplies or shortages might effect the more significant holiday shopping quarter. Last year, Apple reported record revenue of $78.4 billion, 69% from iPhone sales. This year, Wall Street analysts expect Apple will bring in almost $87 billion, up 11%, thanks to a predicted heady 14% gain in iPhone revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s stock price, which had been on a tear ahead of the iPhone announcement event, has been little changed since as investors await more information on early sales. Like last year, but unlike many prior years, Apple did not announce how many iPhones had been preordered in the first weekend. Apple shares hit an all-time high of $164.94 on September 1, but have since fallen back a bit and were trading at $159.29 in midday on Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>With competition <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/07\/iphone-8-deals-wireless\/\">somewhat muted<\/a> in the wireless market this year, the carriers also have <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/12\/best-iphone-8-deals\/\">not been offering<\/a> the same lucrative trade in deals to iPhone buyers that they did in 2016.

Job'","content":"<p>Rather than diffusing an on-going standoff with his airline&#8217;s pilots, Ryanair CEO Michael O&#8217;Leary escalated the situation on Thursday, threatening to cancel some of their scheduled leave and characterizing their jobs as cushy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOnce you are trained and skilled at doing it&#8230; I would challenge any pilot to explain how this is a difficult job or how it is they are overworked or how anybody who by law can\u2019t fly more than 18 hours a week could possibly be suffering from fatigue,\u201d he said at Ryanair&#8217;s annual shareholder meeting on Thursday, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2017\/sep\/21\/ryanair-boss-holiday-plans-michael-oleary-flight-cancellations\">according to <em>The Guardian<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>O&#8217;Leary&#8217;s comments come days after the discount carrier announced that it would be <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/17\/ryanair-flight-cancellations\/\">cancelling up to 50 flights a day for the next six weeks<\/a> due to an internal mix-up in the planning of pilots&#8217; time off. The mishap affected over 300,000 passengers and 2% of all Ryanair flights in the period. The airline said on Wednesday that it expected to re-accommodate over 175,000 of those customers by the end of the day.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Read<\/strong>: <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/18\/ryanair-stock-flight-cancellations\/\" rel=\"\">RyanAir\u2019s Stock Is Tumbling As It Cancels Hundreds of Flights<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>To ease the on-going crisis, Ryanair <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"ryaof\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a data-type=\"stock-ticker:ryaof\" class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/ryaof\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">ryaof<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/21\/ryanair-cancellations-pilots\/\">had offered pilots a tax-free one-time bonus of \u00a312,000 (about $16,000)<\/a> if they agreed to work extra days, which would have headed off further cancellations. But a group of pilots rejected that offer on Thursday and threatened to launch a \u201cwork to rule\u201d campaign. &#8220;Working to rule&#8221; means pilots would refuse to work outside the constraints of their employment contracts.

The latter is sacrilegious to a Googler: \u201cI almost feel like I\u2019m in the 1990s,\u201d Georgiadis admits.<\/p>\n<p>She might as well be in the 1950s or 1960s, because the products that Mattel introduced in those decades\u2014flagship franchises Barbie and Hot Wheels\u2014still make up about 30% of the 72-year-old company\u2019s global sales. These aging brands consistently rank among the top toys sold worldwide (see \u201cHow Little Things Change\u201d below), but they haven\u2019t exactly been springboards for innovation. And not coincidentally, Mattel\u2019s revenue has slipped in recent years: In its last fiscal year, sales came in at $5.5 billion, 14% less than in 2012. Its stock price, meanwhile, has slid from $37 to $16 over the past five years.

Rivals Hasbro and Lego also face challenges, as all three struggle to stay on top of the $49 billion global toy market.

Among the factors Johnson blamed: \u201cFatigue in certain properties associated with multiple sequels, and competition from entertainment from other screens.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ah, yes, those \u201cother screens.\u201d In a digitally saturated era where even toddlers reflexively grab their parents\u2019 smartphones for stimulation, technology presents a seemingly unsolvable puzzle for traditional toymakers. The more kids consume iPad apps and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/netflix\/\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix<\/a> shows, the less time they spend playing with dolls or snapping together small, colorful bricks. (Privately held Lego has also suffered: In early September, following a 5% drop in midyear sales, the Danish company announced it would slash 8% of its workforce.) From an outsider\u2019s perspective, the industry stands at an existential threshold: To break out of its rut, it has to go digital.<\/p>\n<p><em>For more about Mattel&#8217;s tech efforts, read &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/mattel-barbie-ceo-google\/ \u200e\">5 Ways Toymaker Mattel Is Trying to Be More Like Google<\/a>.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>But here\u2019s the problem: Kids may love screens, but it\u2019s not clear that they like \u201ctech toys.\u201d The toys they gravitate toward\u2014or at least the toys their parents buy for them\u2014remain largely analog. Think Pok\u00e9mon cards, Nerf guns and balls, and, yes, Barbie dolls, all among the five bestselling toy properties this year, according to research firm NPD Group. \u201cThere are pockets driven by technology,\u201d says Juli Lennett, an NPD analyst. \u201cBut most growth still tends to be driven by some of the classic play patterns.\u201d Another example: The fastest-growing category of toys sold so far this year was games and puzzles, a grouping that doesn\u2019t include video games. As Stephen Pasierb, CEO of the Toy Association, a trade organization, argues, \u201cMany parents want their kids to have some digital detox.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-medium-width aligncenter\" style=\"max-width:500px;\" ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat_graphic1.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2158907\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/mattel-ceo-most-powerful-women\/mat_graphic\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat_graphic1.png?w=500&#038;h=594\" data-orig-size=\"1220,1450\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"MAT_graphic\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Charts show toy sales in the U.S., and activities kids are engaged in&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat_graphic1.png?w=500&#038;h=594?w=252\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat_graphic1.png?w=500&#038;h=594?w=862\" class=\"wp-image-2158907\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat_graphic1.png?w=500&#038;h=594\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"594\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat_graphic1.png?w=500&amp;h=594 500w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat_graphic1.png?w=1000&amp;h=1188 1000w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat_graphic1.png?w=126&amp;h=150 126w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat_graphic1.png?w=252&amp;h=300 252w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat_graphic1.png?w=768&amp;h=913 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat_graphic1.png?w=862&amp;h=1024 862w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Nicolas Rapp<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Parents may not want screens and technology to replace toys. They do, however, want toys that meet the expectations that tech creates\u2014more interactivity and customization, for starters. They also want to be able to buy toys without going shopping, which helps explain why once-dominant retailer <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/19\/toys-r-us-bankruptcy-protection\/\">Toys \u201cR\u201d Us filed for bankruptcy<\/a> in mid-September, buckling under the weight of e-commerce giant <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/amazon-com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a> (and creating another headache for big toymakers). As Mattel board member Dean Scarborough, chairman of labelmaker <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/avery-dennison\/\" target=\"_blank\">Avery Dennison<\/a>, puts it, the business is no longer a simple process of \u201cproducing an item, advertising on TV, and pushing it into the stores.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This is the gauntlet Georgiadis is running. The exec is already shaking things up, in a Google-y way, developing a shared technical infrastructure for toy development and investing in digital marketing. (Until recently, nearly all of Mattel\u2019s ad spending was invested in television.) \u201cWe needed someone from the digital world,\u201d says Scarborough. \u201cAnd it\u2019s pretty hard to get more digital than Google.\u201d Ruth Porat, the search giant\u2019s chief financial officer, expresses faith in her former colleague, pointing out that Georgiadis ran one of Google\u2019s most important businesses, giving her the background she\u2019ll need for \u201capplying cutting-edge tech into all parts of Mattel\u2019s business.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Some toys, though, are better left in their analog state, and Georgiadis will have to know which levers to pull and when. There\u2019s nothing particularly high-tech about the Chatter Telephone, for example. On the windowsill in the CEO\u2019s shared office sits the smiling, plastic pull toy, first developed in 1961. It is a reminder that all the 0s and 1s in the world don\u2019t diminish the appeal of a ringing rotary phone, as far as babies (and their parents) are concerned. In 2000, Mattel upgraded the old model with a push-button design that lit up. The result? Consumers protested, and the company brought back the original version.<\/p>\n<p>If there\u2019s a lesson there, perhaps it\u2019s this: In a data-driven age, there is a science to developing products that match kids\u2019 \u201cplay patterns.\u201d But there is also an art.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>After taking the top job last February, Georgiadis did what all new outsider CEOs are expected to do: She traveled the country, talking to as many of Mattel\u2019s 32,000 employees as possible. Then she tore down a Barbie Dreamhouse.<\/p>\n<p>Like Barbie herself, the mockup Malibu pad, first conceived of in 1962, has gotten multiple touch-ups over the years. By the \u201970s, the one-story abode had grown to three floors and an elevator. In the 1990s Mattel spruced it up with a working doorbell and a fireplace that lit up. And last holiday season, Barbie moved into her first \u201cWi-Fi, voice-activated\u201d Dreamhouse, which enabled kids to open doors using spoken commands. (With a price of $240, that\u2019s about $30 per square foot.)<\/p>\n<p>But according to Georgiadis, Wi-Fi wasn\u2019t enough to bring the 58-year-old Barbie into the Internet age. That\u2019s why she brought a screwdriver to the weekly management meeting and took apart the latest Dreamhouse, laying out each component\u2014and each flaw\u2014for all to see.<\/p>\n<p>For starters, the voice-activated parts had a cumbersome amount of circuitry. \u201cThere were, like, seven chipboards in that thing,\u201d Georgiadis says. Not only were the chipboards completely separate\u2014not communicating with each other\u2014but Mattel wasn\u2019t using them to their full potential. The toymaker wasn\u2019t recording or saving Dreamhouse owners\u2019 voice commands\u2014much less combining them into a system that could learn and evolve, otherwise known as natural language processing. \u201cYou want to know, how many times did she [the owner] talk to it, what questions does she ask that you don\u2019t answer?\u201d says Georgiadis. For an executive schooled at Google, whose parent company Alphabet makes $90 billion a year primarily by pumping data into algorithms and using it to serve up ads, this lapse was unfathomable.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-medium-width aligncenter\" style=\"max-width:450px;\" ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-hotwheelsdesign.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2160683\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/mattel-ceo-most-powerful-women\/mat-10-01-17-hotwheelsdesign\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-hotwheelsdesign.jpg?w=450&#038;h=679\" data-orig-size=\"1272,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;6.3&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Angie Smith for FORTUNE&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 5D Mark II&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1505388667&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;35&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;250&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.02&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;MAT.10.01.17.hotwheelsdesign&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"MAT.10.01.17.hotwheelsdesign\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-hotwheelsdesign.jpg?w=450&#038;h=679?w=199\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-hotwheelsdesign.jpg?w=450&#038;h=679?w=678\" class=\"wp-image-2160683\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-hotwheelsdesign.jpg?w=450&#038;h=679\" alt=\"MAT.10.01.17.hotwheelsdesign\" width=\"450\" height=\"679\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-hotwheelsdesign.jpg?w=450&amp;h=679 450w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-hotwheelsdesign.jpg?w=900&amp;h=1358 900w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-hotwheelsdesign.jpg?w=99&amp;h=150 99w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-hotwheelsdesign.jpg?w=199&amp;h=300 199w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-hotwheelsdesign.jpg?w=768&amp;h=1159 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-hotwheelsdesign.jpg?w=678&amp;h=1024 678w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Staffers work on Hot Wheels at Mattel\u2019s Design Center in El Segundo, Calif.

(Other chip-equipped Mattel toys, like a Hot Wheels track that uses computer smarts to steer cars around, suffered from the same problem.)<\/p>\n<p>The most encouraging thing about the deconstruction session: Georgiadis\u2019s colleagues got the message. \u201cThe minute we took the thing apart to explain all of the opportunities we were missing, everyone said. \u2018Oh, my God, that\u2019s so obvious,\u2019\u2009\u201d she says. Now she\u2019s realigning the company around that kind of revelation. She has hired a chief technology officer who has taken over all engineering resources. More developers are being hired, and a common technology platform for things like voice recognition is in the works. Georgiadis envisions that, someday, language processing tech developed with the Dreamhouse in mind will also be used in, say, a Fisher-Price baby swing, to track how a child\u2019s cry is impacted by different speeds. \u201cSkip the focus group,\u201d she says, because with tech, \u201cYou have an everyday focus group.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The new CEO is utilizing data elsewhere too. She wants to move Mattel entirely to shared systems\u2014enterprise resource planning software, for example, and collaboration tools like Yammer. \u201cForecasting, demand planning, all these kinds of things are more data-driven,\u201d says Georgiadis; the tools she favors could make that kind of information available to more people, more quickly.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-prototypes.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2160681\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/mattel-ceo-most-powerful-women\/mat-10-01-17-prototypes\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-prototypes.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=702\" data-orig-size=\"2800,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;11&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Angie Smith for FORTUNE&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 5D Mark II&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1505389626&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;27&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;250&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.025&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;MAT.10.01.17.prototypes&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"MAT.10.01.17.prototypes\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-prototypes.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=702?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-prototypes.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=702?w=1024\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2160681\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-prototypes.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=702\" alt=\"MAT.10.01.17.prototypes\" width=\"1024\" height=\"702\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-prototypes.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=702 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-prototypes.jpg?w=2048&amp;h=1404 2048w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-prototypes.jpg?w=150&amp;h=103 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-prototypes.jpg?w=300&amp;h=206 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-prototypes.jpg?w=768&amp;h=527 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Angie Smith for FORTUNE<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Getting Mattel\u2019s divisions to collaborate poses geographical challenges too. While flagship brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels operate out of headquarters in Southern California, other divisions are cleaved from the core. Many are acquisitions that are still parked in their hometowns. American Girl, maker of dolls from different points in history, is based in Wisconsin. Mega, a block-toys arm, is in Canada, and Fisher-Price, the brand for smaller tots, is based in New York, to name a few. \u201cThis company that had a huge potential was really almost like a house of brands,\u201d says Georgiadis. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a shared mission.\u201d To get everyone on the same page, Georgiadis has written a new code of shared values (the initials of the six precepts spell out \u201cWONDER\u201d) and instituted monthly Google-style \u201ctown halls.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>For more on Georgiadis&#8217;s reforms at Mattel, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/mattel-barbie-ceo-google\/ \u200e\">click here<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Of course, however sweeping her reforms, there is no real-life Magic 8 Ball (the Mattel-owned toy launched in the 1950s) that can help Georgiadis see which products will sell and which will flop.

Mattel\u2019s bureaucracy has likely stifled innovation. How could smart ideas bubble to the top when it was hard for designers to even reach the management on the top floor? \u201cLiterally, there were guards and codes and badges,\u201d says Dickson, the COO and Georgiadis\u2019 office mate, who has spent 13 years at Mattel. No one, until Georgiadis, had ever asked him to share an office. No one had broken down the silos between brands. In fact, no one had even managed to bridge the gap between the company\u2019s corporate tower and the flatter, cooler building right across the street.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>The day after I visit the tower, I tour the \u201cDesign Center,\u201d a warehouse-style building with high ceilings and, well, a lot of toys\u2014a space that\u2019s as fun as the HQ is drab. This is where about 700 of the company\u2019s creatives sit\u2014toy developers, graphic designers, and even Barbie hair specialists. There are no elves or mopeds, but there is a sprawling, orange Hot Wheels track, where I stand on top of a ladder and send a silvery, die-cast toy car whizzing through the lobby. In a nearby chemistry lab, a machine slowly mixes sparkly goo. I pick up a plastic pony and dip it into water\u2014it changes from pink to yellow. So this is where the magic happens.<\/p>\n<p>This warehouse isn\u2019t actually a factory; the majority of Mattel toys are manufactured abroad. The Design Center is for conceptualizing, developing, and testing new versions of the flagship brands that have been around almost since the company began. That\u2019s one reason that, even in its colorful cacophony, the center feels stuck in time. One of the first things I notice is the separation between girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 toys. Exactly half of the 200,000-square-foot floor is devoted to Barbie and other \u201cgirl brands\u201d like spooky-doll line Monster High. There are rows and rows of Barbies on shelves and in employees\u2019 cubicles, many of which are partitioned with frilly white curtains. One disconcerting display showcases dozens of Barbie heads\u2014just the heads\u2014stuck on top of perfectly arranged spokes like so many Barbie-headed lollipops, showing off the variations of their hairstyles. The other side of the building is devoted to \u201cboys\u2019 toys,\u201d mainly Hot Wheels but also brawny WWE figurines. The juxtaposition\u2014muscle cars and muscled-up action figures on one side and hyper-feminine dolls on the other\u2014seems outdated, if not downright out of touch.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-medium-width aligncenter\" style=\"max-width:450px;\" ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-barbiedesign.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2160682\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/mattel-ceo-most-powerful-women\/mat-10-01-17-barbiedesign\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-barbiedesign.jpg?w=450&#038;h=589\" data-orig-size=\"1278,1674\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;7.1&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Angie Smith for FORTUNE&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 5D Mark II&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1505390020&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;35&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;250&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.025&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;MAT.10.01.17.barbiedesign&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"MAT.10.01.17.barbiedesign\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-barbiedesign.jpg?w=450&#038;h=589?w=229\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-barbiedesign.jpg?w=450&#038;h=589?w=782\" class=\"wp-image-2160682\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-barbiedesign.jpg?w=450&#038;h=589\" alt=\"MAT.10.01.17.barbiedesign\" width=\"450\" height=\"589\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-barbiedesign.jpg?w=450&amp;h=589 450w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-barbiedesign.jpg?w=900&amp;h=1178 900w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-barbiedesign.jpg?w=115&amp;h=150 115w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-barbiedesign.jpg?w=229&amp;h=300 229w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-barbiedesign.jpg?w=768&amp;h=1006 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/mat-10-01-17-barbiedesign.jpg?w=782&amp;h=1024 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">A staffer works on Barbie clothing at Mattel\u2019s Design Center in El Segundo, Calif.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Angie Smith for FORTUNE<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>In both its gender dichotomy and its old-school, siloed feel, the Design Center shows how much Mattel needs to play catch-up. \u201cI really applaud the efforts Mattel has made to update Barbie,\u201d says Debbie Sterling, founder and CEO of STEM toy startup Goldieblox. \u201cBut there\u2019s a real challenge around the legacy of Barbie and what she stands for.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Oakland-based Goldieblox sells games that teach building and early engineering skills, with a focus on attracting girls. It\u2019s one of many toy upstarts that are steadfastly steering clear of gender stereotypes. Another Bay Area toy newbie, Wonder Workshop, builds turquoise-and-orange robots used by kids who are learning to program. To date, the company has shipped more than 300,000 of its bulbous \u201cDash\u201d robots\u2014marketed to boys and girls alike\u2014that scoot around according to simple instructions programmed by kids. And New York\u2013based LittleBits is also being gender&#8211;neutral in selling its inventor kits that enable kids to build and control robots. The company got a licensing deal with Lucasfilm after participating in an accelerator run by its parent company, Walt Disney. Its latest product? A build-it-yourself version of iconic droid R2-D2.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Regardless of what they make, toy startups have an advantage that Mattel, Hasbro, and Lego lack: They can start supply chains and distribution models from scratch. That means they can \u201cfail fast,\u201d testing products with the rapidity of a tech company, and tap e-commerce and digital advertising instead of breaking into bricks and mortar and shelling out millions for TV ads. In all these ways, the startups are much farther down a road that Big Toy is still scouting out.<\/p>\n<p>The toy giants know they need to take a tech-centric approach to product development and shed their more cumbersome production processes. \u201cWe have added complexity into the organization which now in turn makes it harder for us to grow further,\u201d Lego\u2019s executive chairman J\u00f8rgen Vig Knudstorp acknowledged in a news release announcing the company\u2019s recent layoffs. \u201cWe have now pressed the reset button.\u201d In August, the company ousted its CEO and appointed a new leader, Niels Christiansen, the former head of engineering company Danfoss\u2014hiring a techie outsider in an unprecedented move for the family-owned company.<\/p>\n<p>Like Mattel and Lego, Hasbro is hitting a wall; analysts expect revenue growth to slow from 13% in 2016 to just 3% in 2018, and its stock is down almost 20% from its highs this summer. As investors lose faith in its movie tie-ins, Hasbro is stretching in unfamiliar, screen-based directions. The company recently announced that its first Netflix series, <i>Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters,<\/i> will launch in late 2017. That\u2019s a move that\u2019s simultaneously new (a show on a streaming service!) and old-fashioned (the original Stretch Armstrong doll was a hit upon its debut\u2014in 1976).<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>Toy Titans Retool<\/h2>\n<p><em>Here\u2019s how the three biggest companies in the traditional toy industry are adapting to a digital age.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Mattel<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>HQ:<\/strong> El Segundo, Calif.<br \/>\n<strong>2016 revenue:<\/strong> $5.5 Billion (\u20134% from 2015)<\/p>\n<p>The Hot Wheels maker is developing tech \u201cplatforms\u201d like natural language processing to use across multiple toy lines. Leading the charge are Google-trained CEO Margo Georgiadis and chief technology officer Sven Gerjets, a former CIO of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/time-warner\/\" target=\"_blank\">Time Warner<\/a> Cable. The tech-centric approach is new at Mattel, which still makes about $1 billion a year from a very analog product: Barbie dolls.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lego<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>HQ:<\/strong> Billund, Denmark<br \/>\n<strong>2016 revenue:<\/strong> $5.4 billion (+6% from 2015)<\/p>\n<p>Lego\u2019s new CEO, Niels Christiansen, wants to simplify and speed up the company\u2019s business processes, while bridging the gap between physical building blocks and digital 0s and 1s. After a strong decade, Lego\u2019s growth has significantly tapered off, leading the company to eliminate 1,400 jobs and hire Christiansen, who comes from an engineering and manufacturing background.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hasbro<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>HQ:<\/strong> Pawtucket, R.I.<br \/>\n<strong>2016 revenue:<\/strong> $5 billion (+13% from 2015)<\/p>\n<p>Even Play-Doh got a tech makeover at Hasbro, owner of brands like Monopoly and Easy-Bake Oven. Last year it launched an app that digitizes Play-Doh creations, allowing kids to interact with their sculpted dinosaurs and kittens on a screen. Still, much of Hasbro\u2019s growth comes from traditional toys that build on license agreements with the likes of Disney\u2019s Lucasfilm.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>But no big toymaker is making a bigger tech bet than Mattel. Georgiadis wants Mattel to emulate the speed and efficiency of Silicon Valley. That\u2019s why she\u2019s asked the company\u2019s head of supply chain to rely on fewer vendors, and why she\u2019s asked all executives to follow her \u201cRule of Two,\u201d which allows just two senior execs to make a decision (before Georgiadis, it usually took four or five). It\u2019s also why utilizing customer data in toy development is such an urgent project.<\/p>\n<p>Retooling Mattel could take many more years, of course\u2014especially given the typical 18-month concept-to-market cycle in the industry. Georgiadis says she had a modest hand in this year\u2019s holiday toy lineup, most of which was already under development when she joined the company.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, she\u2014and her competitors\u2014will still be able to draw inspiration from the pre-digital past. In one corner of Mattel\u2019s Design Center, I come face to face with some real magic: A machine that once made reels for View-Masters, the bright red 3D \u201cstereoscopes\u201d\u2014invented in 1939\u2014that many of us grew up with. This clunky apparatus, which operated for seven decades at a plant in Mexico, isn\u2019t much to look at. But it likely helped instill awe and wonder in thousands or millions of children worldwide.<\/p>\n<p>In 2015, Mattel struck a partnership with Google to bring the toy back to life with a techie twist. The \u201cView-Master Virtual Reality Viewer\u201d was built on the search company\u2019s Cardboard VR platform, and was applauded for bringing VR technology to younger audiences at an affordable price. Georgiadis\u2019s mission is to create product platforms that kindle similar magic\u2014but with the staying power of Barbie and Hot Wheels.<\/p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appears in the Oct.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are here to stay.<\/h2>\n<p>Most people who are enthusiastic about cryptocurrency appear to agree that Bitcoin and its newer rival Ethereum have staying power, though they may be more bullish on one versus the other. &#8220;In terms of 5 to 10 years, Bitcoin and Ether will be around I bet,&#8221; Balaji Srinivasan told the room of more than 70 people.<\/p>\n<p>Peter Smith said his company, Blockchain, which was early to Bitcoin, has only just started to warm up to newcomer Ethereum. In contrast, Mike Cagney, CEO and cofounder of SoFi, a personal finance company, said during a separate session on the main stage that he was <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/19\/bitcoin-ethereum-blockchain-sofi\/\">hotter on the latter technology<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin &#8220;has some purpose but its application for commercial transaction is limited right now,&#8221; Cagney said. &#8220;The blockchain and Ethereum, on the other hand, have absolutely fascinating infrastructure applications,\u201d he continued, mentioning the possibility to overhaul title insurance, which involves policies related to real estate, as one example.<\/p>\n<h2>2. <strong>As yet unknown coins will hit the big time.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Bitcoin and Ethereum may have stolen the show at this point, but the innovation won\u2019t end there. Expect more winners on the horizon.<\/p>\n<p>Kathleen Breitman is hopeful that Tezos, her own blockchain bet, will fill a niche that solves problems with extant blockchains. In particular, she and her project\u2019s developers are designing Tezos to automatically push software updates out to the network, thus, in theory, avoiding the divisive feuding over upgrades that has wracked systems like Bitcoin over the past few years.<\/p>\n<p>No one can say how many tokens and coins and blockchain protocols will eventually win out, but the experts seem to think there\u2019s room for a multitude. &#8220;It\u2019s likely that another one or two dominant ones we haven\u2019t seen yet in the market,&#8221; Smith projected. &#8220;Another really dominant coin could come out this year or next year.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>3. <strong>Sure, people will get burned.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>For the time being, token sales might seem like a fantastic way to raise a lot of money quickly and with few questions asked. Will this lead to riches for some? Undoubtedly\u2014indeed, it already has. And rip-offs for others? Almost certainly.<\/p>\n<p>Smith said he presumes that market manipulation and insider dealing is rampant among purveyors of initial coin offerings. \u201cWe\u2019re cautious about it in the short term,\u201d Smith said of his company. \u201cBut you have to temper that with the idea that every new technology is going to be like that in the beginning.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple and a former executive at <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/yahoo\/\" target=\"_blank\">Yahoo<\/a>, voiced his less forgiving concerns about the sector on a separate panel. \u201cHeavily regulated markets are typically heavily regulated for a reason,\u201d he said. \u201cFrauds are happening, people are going to jail.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>4. <strong>ICOs will (eventually) give Silicon Valley and Wall Street a run for their money.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The days of making a pilgrimage to the homes of the holders of purse strings are coming to an end. In a world where anyone can participate as an investor online, physical location matters much less.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt used to be you had to come to Silicon Valley, walk up Sand Hill Road, network with individuals,\u201d Srinivasan said about entrepreneurs seeking funding, often strolling up a strip to the west of Palo Alto that long has been associated with venture capital firms. ICOs change all that.<\/p>\n<p>Projects are already getting funded this Kickstarter-like new way. Breitman said she that when she set up Tezos\u2019 token sale, she aimed to <strong>\u201c<\/strong>get as many people who wanted to participate in the ecosystem to contribute.\u201d The company raised more than $200 million to date and, according to her, more than 30,000 Tezos wallets have been opened.<\/p>\n<h2>5. <strong>Regulations will stick.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Elena Kvochko, chief information officer of the security division at Barclays, said that her bank has had <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2017\/06\/26\/barclays-bitcoin-regulators-fca.html\">talks with regulators<\/a> about Bitcoin, blockchains, and their ilk. The rule-sticklers appear to be open to the idea as long as \u201cknow your customer\u201d laws are obeyed, although its still early days.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, as governments settle on sets of rules of the road, countries like Switzerland, Singapore, and Estonia are jostling to develop frameworks that easily accommodate the new technology, Srinivasan said. They\u2019re seeking to displace geographic incumbents and become hubs for a new wave of business financing. \u201cIf you\u2019re a U.S. person or business, you have a good deal to be concerned about,\u201d Smith said.<\/p>\n<p>Breitman added that until the rules are agreed upon, it\u2019s \u201cbest to be transparent\u201d about what one is doing.<\/p>\n<h2>6. <strong>Speculation will subside as \u201ckiller apps\u201d take hold.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As cryptocurrency prices fluctuate wildly, speculators have been having a field day. However, there\u2019s reason to believe the markets will become more stable, as Bitcoin gradually has over the past couple of years (despite its still big price swings), Smith said.<\/p>\n<p>In order for these computer coins to catch on big-time, they need a use-case that beats traditional money. Ideally, this ought to be better than merely \u201cbuying drugs,\u201d as Jeff John Roberts, <em>Fortune<\/em> reporter and the session\u2019s moderator, noted.<\/p>\n<p>Srinivasan proposed one possible scenario. Imagine that \u201call your waking hours are spent in the Matrix,\u201d he said, referring to a virtual reality in which everyone is enmeshed in the future. As people from all over the world meet and interact, they will need a medium of exchange. \u201cTo transact, you can\u2019t just hand over a dollar bill,\u201d Srinivasan said. \u201cYou need an international currency for that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt might take a while but there\u2019s going to be more of a need to transact across borders than there is today,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<h2>7. <strong>Cryptocurrencies will pressure incumbents to improve<\/strong><strong>.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Whenever a consumer swipes or dips a credit card, payment processors charge a fee.<\/p>\n<p>Nicko van Someren, chief technology officer of the Linux Foundation, pointed out that the fee companies like <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/visa\/\" target=\"_blank\">Visa<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/mastercard\/\" target=\"_blank\">Mastercard<\/a> charge exceeds the cost to clear or settle transactions. These businesses can potentially process transactions quicker and cheaper, he contended.<\/p>\n<p>One potential outcome of the adoption of alternate systems, like Bitcoin, is to provide companies with the impetus to improve their services. \u201cBitcoin is good because it will make banks move toward the real cost of handling these transactions,\u201d van Someren said. (By extension, in Ethereum&#8217;s case, one could imagine upstart companies built on it forcing giants like <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/amazon-com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/facebook\/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook<\/a>, or Dropbox to reconsider or improve their respective offerings.)<\/p>\n<p>Smith, meanwhile, was less optimistic about incumbents\u2019 ability to adapt to such change. \u201cI don\u2019t think be lot of room for banks to simply adjust their price models,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July

The latest Equifax update is that <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/13\/equifax-data-breach-investigation\/\">nearly 40 states<\/a> are investigating the incident, and a bunch of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/12\/equifax-data-breach-senate-finance-committee\/\">senators have questions<\/a> as well.<\/p>\n<p>And while those efforts may provide you with a bit of schadenfreude, they won&#8217;t ultimately help you to find out if your information was leaked or if you need to freeze your credit. You&#8217;re on your own in solving this problem, but it doesn&#8217;t need to haunt you forever.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what you can do this weekend about the Equifax hack:<\/p>\n<h3>Step 1: Educate yourself. What is Equifax?<\/h3>\n<p>One of the big three consumer credit reporting agencies, the Atlanta-based company collects banking and lending data on consumers and businesses that companies use to determine the amount they&#8217;ll give out in loans or on credit cards. The company has been in business since 1899, and has a vast repository of personally identifying information, including names, social security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and even driver\u2019s license numbers. This sensitive data is exactly the kind of information used in identity theft, which is why this Equifax hack is so alarming people.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 2: Find out if your information leaked Equifax<\/h3>\n<p>The Equifax breach exposed the information of nearly half the population of the United States. So, flip a coin\u2014that&#8217;s the likelihood your data is now in hackers&#8217; hands.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, one problem in the Equifax dispute is that you have to check with the company to find out if your data was exposed, and that means providing them with even more information (your last name and the last six digits of your social security number). But at the moment, that&#8217;s the only way to find out if you were affected by Equifax breach. To start the process, Equifax has set up a special website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.equifaxsecurity2017.com\/\">www.equifaxsecurity2017.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 3: Enroll in a free year of Equifax credit monitoring<\/h3>\n<p>After Equifax checks your status the company will offer a year of its TrustedID Premier credit monitoring for free. Whether your data was exposed or not, take them up on the offer. If your information is at risk, you&#8217;ll want to keep the company on the hook to keep your finances safe as long as possible. And if your data wasn&#8217;t touched, it&#8217;s smart to have Equifax security products standing watch, regardless.<\/p>\n<p>You may have heard a rumor that if you accepted Equifax free credit monitoring, you&#8217;re forfeiting your right to sue. That&#8217;s no longer true. Criticism from the public has led Equifax to updated its terms to say &#8220;enrolling in the free credit file monitoring&#8230; does not prohibit consumers from taking legal action.&#8221; In fact, if you want to sue Equifax, a programmer even made <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/13\/equifax-data-breach-chatbot-protect\/\">a chatbot to make filing the paperwork<\/a> easy for you.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 4: Beware Equifax phone scammers<\/h3>\n<p>While it&#8217;s a bit unsettling to handle all this sensitive business online, keep in mind that you&#8217;re one of 143 million people affected by the Equifax hack. The company will not be calling you. In fact, if you do get a phonecall from someone claiming to be from Equifax, it&#8217;s likely <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/14\/equifax-scams-ftc\/\">a scammer trying to steal even more information<\/a>. Don&#8217;t answer their calls, and if you do, certainly don&#8217;t answer any of their questions.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 5: Check your accounts for suspicious activity<\/h3>\n<p>The Equifax credit monitoring offer is great, but it only works once you turn it on. These bad guys busted into the company&#8217;s servers in mid-May, so they&#8217;ve already had months to wreak havoc with your finances. Instead of flipping through <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/facebook\/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook<\/a> this weekend, look through your bank records to make sure everything is how you remember it. If it isn&#8217;t, you may want to take the next step.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 6: Set up a fraud alert or credit freeze<\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve found suspicious activity within your accounts, are nervous about your personal info floating around somewhere in cyberspace, or simply want to be extra careful with your credit, you can sign up for fraud alerts or a credit freeze.<\/p>\n<p>Fraud alerts are good for stopping someone from opening a new credit accounts in your name. They work by requiring creditors to verify your identity before they can get a copy of your credit report. There are several types of fraud alerts. Initial fraud alerts last for at least 90 days. An extended fraud alert lasts for seven years. And active duty military alerts are available for a year for deployed members of the armed forces. Setting up a fraud alert through any of the major credit reporting agencies will prompt them to coordinate with each other to make sure your records are protected across all the companies.<\/p>\n<p>If fraud alerts don&#8217;t sound secure enough, you can set up a credit freeze, also known as a security freeze. Credit freezes restrict access to credit reports, denying new creditors from viewing your information, and as a result fraudsters cannot open new accounts. Credit freezes don&#8217;t lock down your open accounts or affect your credit score. Credit freezes cost up to $10 per credit reporting company, last until you ask them to remove it (except for in a few states where they expire after seven years), and cost money to have them removed. Keep in mind, credit freezes will lock everyone out\u2014even potential employers screening you for a new job.<\/p>\n<p>In the days since the Equifax hack was revealed, some people have complained that the Equifax credit freeze was not working. This, unfortunately, is what happens when a large number of people <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/money\/2017\/09\/13\/equifax-data-breach-tried-freeze-my-credit-there-were-problems\/663014001\/\">try to freeze their credit<\/a> at the same time. Hopefully it is already running more smoothly.<\/p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve navigated your way through these six steps, you can rest assured that your credit is as safe as it can be. Now you can take the rest of the weekend off. After all that hard work, you deserve it.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 15, 2017","published":"2017-09-15 06:24:31","updated":"2017-09-15 06:24:31","minute":"6:24 PM

Banned","content":"<p>Transport for London, the city&#8217;s transportation authority, on <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/uber-lost-license-london\/\">Friday effectively banned Uber<\/a> in the capital after determining that Uber London Limited &#8220;is not fit and proper to hold a private hire operator license.&#8221; It was a stunning decision (one that Uber plans to appeal) and the latest twist in what&#8217;s been an especially rocky road even for the startup used to clashing with municipal authorities. Here&#8217;s a brief look at Uber&#8217;s history in London that led up to Friday&#8217;s shocking news.<\/p>\n<p><strong>July 2012<\/strong>: Uber launches operations in London, just before the city hosts the Summer Olympic Games. At a time when the U.K. is still recovering from the Great Recession, it is welcomed as a job-creator and as a way of letting people get more out of their squeezed incomes. &#8220;London is the gold standard,&#8221; CEO Travis Kalanick tells <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2012\/06\/26\/uber-wants-london-but-it-faces-the-fight-of-its-life\/\">Gigaom<\/a> at the time\u2014a market it needed to crack or else give up pretensions of remaking the taxi business worldwide.<\/p>\n<p><strong>July 2013<\/strong>: Uber launches its premium UberX service, a development that will upend not only the black cab business, but also that of Addison Lee, an upmarket minicab service owned by private equity group Carlyle.<\/p>\n<p><strong>June 2014<\/strong>: Black cabs stage the first of a number of protests against Uber that bring central London to a standstill. Downloads of the Uber app <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-london-27799938\">spike by 850%<\/a> as Uber scores a PR victory against what Kalanick called an &#8220;asshole named Taxi.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size:16px;\">December 2014<\/strong><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">: The London Assembly concludes that Transport for London&#8217;s policing of the private hire industry (not just Uber) is &#8220;not fit for purpose&#8221; and &#8220;woefully inadequate.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Read More: <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/uber-lost-license-london\/\" rel=\"\">Uber Just Lost Its License in London<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>May 2015<\/strong>: Uber hires Rachel Whetstone, a close friend of Prime Minister David Cameron and godmother to his late son, to head its public policy and communications unit in London. By now, Uber is attracting hundreds of new drivers every week with generous incentives.<\/p>\n<p><strong>July 2015<\/strong>: The London Private Hire Car Association calls on the European Union to investigate Uber&#8217;s tax practices. The company routes almost all of its international payments through the Netherlands, which means it pays no U.K. tax on the fees it receives through U.K. drivers. The Netherlands office operates a licensing deal with another offshore affiliate that protects almost all of its income from taxation (to find out how, read <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/10\/22\/uber-tax-shell\/\">this<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p><strong>August 2015:<\/strong> Within two years of launching, Uber has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/finance\/newsbysector\/transport\/11822711\/Since-Uber-launched-there-are-26pc-more-cabs-in-London.html\">15,000 drivers on the roads on London<\/a>. Kalanick says he expects 42,000 by 2016, a figure he will miss by about 25%.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Read More: <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/22\/hp-hpe-meg-whitman\/\" rel=\"\">HPE\u2019s Meg Whitman Won\u2019t Be Uber\u2019s CEO. But She Could Be the First Female President<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>November 2015:<\/strong> Boris Johnson, then mayor of London, complains that David Cameron&#8217;s government is obstructing his plans for a cap on new licenses because it&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.standard.co.uk\/news\/transport\/government-fails-to-curb-uber-because-it-is-besotted-by-us-tech-firms-says-boris-a3107571.html\">absolutely besotted<\/a>&#8221; by &#8220;Californian tech titans.&#8221; Johnson had complained that the burgeoning number of Uber drivers had led to traffic congestion, pollution and illegal parking throughout the city.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>December 2015:<\/strong> Ten Uber drivers take the company to an employment tribunal, protesting against their treatment. They allege that they earn less than the minimum wage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>May 2016:<\/strong> Sadiq Khan, of the Labour Party, succeeds the Conservatives&#8217; Boris Johnson as mayor of London. Carlyle, the owner of Addison Lee, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.standard.co.uk\/news\/transport\/addison-lee-drivers-plan-protest-in-mayfair-over-pay-cuts-a3254821.html\">forces its drivers to accept pay cuts<\/a> as it tries to stay competitive with Uber.<\/p>\n<p><strong>September 2016:<\/strong> Khan <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/3cfe4e16-7963-11e6-97ae-647294649b28\">proposes new rules<\/a> for cab drivers including tougher driving tests and, controversially, an English-language test. The latter is seen as clamping down on Uber, which draws its drivers largely from immigrant communities, as opposed to the native Londoners who drive most of the fleet of black cabs. He also orders Uber drivers to obtain commercial auto insurance, a large operating cost that many had been avoiding.<\/p>\n<p><strong>October 2016<\/strong>: The U.K. High Court finds for the drivers in the employment tribunal case, saying they&#8217;re entitled to the minimum wage and statutory paid holiday. It pours scorn on Uber&#8217;s tortuous definition of itself as a technology company: &#8220;The notion that Uber in London is a mosaic of 30,000 small businesses linked by a common \u2018platform\u2019 is to our minds faintly ridiculous,\u201d Judge Anthony Nelson wrote in the ruling.<\/p>\n<p><strong>June 2017<\/strong> : <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/19c1afe8-5a8f-11e7-b553-e2df1b0c3220\">A crowd-funded lawsuit claims that Uber<\/a> should be collecting tax. At the time, Reuters estimated that Uber&#8217;s 40,000 U.K. drivers were generating over 1 billion pounds a year ($1.35 billion), indicating that it was avoiding up to 40 million pounds a year in VAT. In the same month, a shareholder revolt forces Kalanick to step down as CEO.<\/p>\n<p><strong>July 2017<\/strong>: The U.K. government releases a report into working practices in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/news\/taylor-review-on-modern-employment-practices-launches\">gig economy<\/a>: it calls for the creation of a new employment status to reflect the gig economy&#8217;s growth, including greater protection for people such as Uber drivers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>August 2017:<\/strong> After a lengthy and public search, Uber selects Dara Khosrowshahi, the CEO of travel site <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/expedia\/\" target=\"_blank\">Expedia<\/a>, as its new CEO.<\/p>\n<p><strong>September 2017<\/strong>: Early in the month, Transport for London bans Taxify, a rival app to Uber backed by China&#8217;s Didi Chuxing, only three days after it announces plans to start operating in London, thwarting its attempt to piggy-back on the license of a partner company. In mid-September, TfL <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/18\/uber-london-fees-license\/\">says it will raise the cost of Uber&#8217;s license to 3 million pounds<\/a> to reflect its scale and the increased cost of policing the sector. The number of private drivers in London has d0ubled to 116,000 in the five years since Uber launched. Finally on Friday, TfL says it won&#8217;t renew Uber&#8217;s license when it expires at the end of the month, saying the company is not a &#8220;fit and proper&#8221; owner and accusing it of inadequate background checks, failing to report criminal incidents to the police and using its &#8216;Greyball&#8217; software to stop regulators from policing it effectively. The company says it will appeal the ruling.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 22, 2017","published":"2017-09-22 04:06:36","updated":"2017-09-22 04:06:36","minute":"4:06 PM

If anything, it\u2019s a supply-chain challenge.<\/p>\n<p><b>Research clearly shows people are wary of aspartame as a sweetener. But when you replaced it with sucralose in Diet Pepsi, consumers didn\u2019t bite. What happened? <\/b><\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a slight taste difference. It\u2019s not a degradation. It\u2019s slightly different. So what\u2019s the problem? This was my biggest puzzle, to be honest.<\/p>\n<p>What consumers think of as healthy is not always science-based. It\u2019s perception, what your friends told you, what the newest story is on the blogs or social media. Some of it might not be based on facts. If you look at potato chips in Whole Foods, they\u2019re not any healthier than Lay\u2019s. In fact I would say Lay\u2019s is even higher quality than what they sell. But just because it comes in a brown bag, people pay extra, thinking it is maybe natural, organic, or handmade. This is the reality of today, and we have to figure out how to market in these new times.<\/p>\n<p><b>Is there a new category you want to get into?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s more about categories that are ripe for disruption. I\u2019ll give you an example: hot beverages. It\u2019s been coffee and tea forever. It hasn\u2019t been disrupted yet. But you go to many local cultures, they drink a lot of other hot beverages. I have to light a creative spark here to get people to think differently. Don\u2019t start with coffee or tea. What\u2019s the best hot beverage that should be sold between November and March that\u2019s totally different, that\u2019s awesome, that people drink and go, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I think about this before?\u201d That\u2019s a space I think is ripe for harvesting, or for a Travis Kalanick or a Brian Chesky to walk in.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/noo10_b.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2158570\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/21\/most-powerful-women-pepsico-indra-nooyi\/president-trump-holds-policy-forum-with-business-leaders-7\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/09\/noo10_b.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" data-orig-size=\"2880,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Chip Somodevilla&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS-1D X Mark II&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 03:  U.S. President Donald Trump (2nd R) delivers opening remarks at the beginning of a policy forum with (L-R) PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi, Blackstone Group Chairman and CEO Stephen Schwarzman, General Motors CEO Mary Barra and other business leaders in the State Dining Room at the White House February 3, 2017 in Washington, DC.

But you also sat on President Trump\u2019s business advisory \u00adcouncil\u2014and were criticized for not stepping down from the group before it was disbanded in the wake of his comments about the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. How do you think about these political issues?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Until the election happens, you can support any candidate you want. There was a candidate that represented the values that I liked, but the day after the election, whoever is elected President is my President. And I congratulated him on that. And even today, he is our President.<\/p>\n<p>It was a well-thought-through idea to get these councils together to help the President debate and discuss certain issues. The political cycle operates in short cycles. The issues and resolutions are long cycles. This is where business can straddle the two.<\/p>\n<p>I think in this case, perhaps some of the comments that had been made post-Charlottesville did create some consternation. If individual CEOs take action, it\u2019s not good for anybody\u2014then each of us becomes a media story. It\u2019s not a decision any of us took lightly, but circumstances demanded that we step down as a group.<\/p>\n<p><b>What went wrong with the Kendall Jenner protest ad, which received a lot of criticism? <\/b><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve thought about it a lot because I looked at the ad again and again and again trying to figure out what went wrong\u2014because it was a peace march not a protest march. It was people in happiness coming together. I realized the scene that caused the most consternation was the final one, when Kendall Jenner gave a Pepsi to the policeman, and it linked back to Black Lives Matter.<\/p>\n<p>This has pained me a lot because this company is known for diversity, and the fact that everybody who produced the commercial and approved the commercial did not link it to Black Lives Matter made me scratch my head. I had not seen that scene. And I take everything personally. The minute I saw people upset, I pulled it. And you know what, it\u2019s not worth it. There were people on both sides, but at the end of the day, our goal is not to offend anybody.<\/p>\n<p><b>What advice would you give women entering the workforce today?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Everybody has to enter the workforce knowing it\u2019s a long journey. For women, know your journey is going to be tougher because you have so many other priorities to worry about. Today people would argue that men have the same priorities. Yes, but women were born with an extra gene that makes us worry about those things just a little bit more. I don\u2019t know why\u2014societal or genetic\u2014but we worry about the family, the husband, evening\u2019s dinner, yesterday morning\u2019s breakfast, aging parents.<\/p>\n<p>Because we have so many issues to worry about we have to compartmentalize even better. We have to develop more skills to write lists and learn how to prioritize. If you don\u2019t know how to do it, go to a course to learn how to do it. I make a list every day of 50, 60 items, and I tick off what I\u2019ve done\u2014tiny things. If I\u2019m carrying two to three items over to the next day, it feels great. People say multitasking isn\u2019t very good. If I didn\u2019t multitask, I have no idea how I\u2019d survive.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Subscribe to the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getbroadsheet\/\">Broadsheet<\/a>, Fortune\u2019s daily newsletter on the world\u2019s most powerful women.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appears in the Oct. 1, 2017 issue of Fortune with the headline &#8220;Queen of Pop.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"September 21, 2017","published":"2017-09-21 06:30:39","updated":"2017-09-21 06:30:39","minute":"6:30 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/21\/most-powerful-women-pepsico-indra-nooyi\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/21\/most-powerful-women-pepsico-indra-nooyi\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/09\/21\/most-powerful-women-pepsico-indra-nooyi\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"11\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5582296006001-11\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5582296006001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2xmUO1e\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/mpw_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dbusiness%2Ccareers%2Cceos%2Centrepreneur%2Cfortune%2Cleadership%2Cmostpowerfulwomen%2Cmostpowerfulwomen%26ch%3Dmpw%26topic%3Dmostpowerfulwomen&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"excerpt":"<p>Indra Nooyi is No. 2 on Fortune\u2019s 2017 Most Powerful Women list.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"381326","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/beth-kowitt\/","name":"Beth Kowitt","twitter":"bethkowitt","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=59 59w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=118 118w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 59px) 100vw, 59px\" data-attachment-id=\"1599149\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/kowitt\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png\" data-orig-size=\"200,200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"BETA HEADSHOTS 2016 \u2014 Beth Kowitt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=200\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=200\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=150",150,150,true],"bio":"Beth Kowitt is a senior writer at Fortune Magazine, where she covers food and agriculture, consumer behavior, and sustainability.

Among the chief executives of <em>Fortune<\/em> 500 companies, a mere two were female: Jill Barad of toymaker <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/mattel\/\" target=\"_blank\">Mattel<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"mat\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a data-type=\"stock-ticker:mat\" class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/mattel\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">mat<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> and Marion Sandler of Golden West Financial (who was a co-CEO with husband Herb). Among the top executive slates at <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\"><em>Fortune<\/em> 500<\/a> companies overall, only one in 10 were women. Among corporate directors, the same dismal share.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, our No. 1 pick for that first MPW list wasn\u2019t a CEO at all, but rather a division president at a telecom firm (Lucent) that no longer exists as a stand-alone company. That was <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/05\/04\/carly-fiorina-famous-president\/\">Carly Fiorina<\/a>\u2014and, at the time, hardly anyone outside of the telecom industry had heard of her, recalls <em>Fortune<\/em>\u2019s Pattie Sellers, who was then a senior writer for the magazine and who helped compile our landmark roster for many years.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe thought about power as something much greater than simply profile, position, or pay,\u201d Pattie <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/1998\/10\/12\/carly-fiorina-most-powerful-women\/\">explained<\/a> in the introduction to that first MPW package. \u201cWe measured power broadly\u2014by revenues and profits controlled, influence inside the company, the importance of the business in the global economy, and its impact on American culture.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>See the full <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/most-powerful-women\/\">Most Powerful Women 2017 list<\/a>.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>And while we\u2019re still gauging corporate clout in the same way today, there\u2019s one big difference between then and now: Women wield more of it than ever. A telling data point? Just as in 1998, a woman\u2014 Margo Georgiadis\u2014sits in the corner suite at Mattel.
