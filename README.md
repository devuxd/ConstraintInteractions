# Constraint Interactions
Each web developer is unique for their organizational and technical approach toward specific HTML coding tasks. Approaches toward certain HTML elements – such as lists, tables, attributes, and tags – depict the specificity of the user’s process, progression, and complexity of development. These web developers are always seeking to optimize their coding productivity. As a result, certain concealed patterns between relationships of elements can be revealed, allowing for monotonous and repetitive code snippets, as well as hidden structural and stylistic patterns, to be made explicit. a tool has been created to take code and tokenize (categorize) certain elements – based on HTML features – into individual buckets. These buckets, consisting of repetitive connate elements, are then further tokenized into larger buckets, consisting of groups of individual buckets comprised of individual element features. In the bucket hierarchy, the first level consists simple elemental features obligatory to HTML development. Individually, these elemental features provide minimal evidence of predictive patterns, but together can derive evidence of tag associations, parent to child tag relationships, relationships between attributes and tags, relationships between attribute values and parent tags, and more. After successful tokenization of these features, the tool orders user-generated elements into a simplistic table consisting of values of each feature. With the prevalence of machine learning, the simplistic data representation is complimented with a predictive decision tree, which provides pertinent feedback to the developer regarding patterns that can allow for auto-complete of code, or the creation of certain templates. This thorough analyzation of elemental data provides developers with a better sense of their unique coding style, allowing for enhanced understanding of the configurational parallels between aspects of their code.
